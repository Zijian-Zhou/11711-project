i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s what singing .
but here we go .
it &apos;s not happening .
yeah , hi .
we love innovation .
solar technology is ...
this is not ...
we were poor .
are they all ?
i &apos;m tom .
1.5 million .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
after a week .
seattle ...
that &apos;s what we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
ta-da !
hold on twice .
here it is .
this is fast .
you need time .
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s hard to do .
it &apos;s interesting .
... not yet .
thank you .
great trick ?
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
just about it .
one ?
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
sustainable .
suck .
fine .
thank you .
unique .
thank you .
maybe not .
ol√© !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
come on .
positive .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
60,000 .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
whoa !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
pretty simple .
thank you .
thank you .
that &apos;s true .
here we go .
seriously .
well , yeah .
is this possible ?
thank you .
about it .
fantastic .
thank you .
all right .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
hi there !
wow !
thank you .
thank you .
okay .
no .
really .
yeah .
okay .
thank you .
yeah !
creativity .
yes ?
yes ?
yeah .
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
yes ?
this is it .
yeah .
yeah .
yes ?
why ?
what was the result ?
i was faced with him .
players don &apos;t sit around .
so they can do that .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so let &apos;s see .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
what do these people need ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i thought about it .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
they use their hands .
so how does this work ?
how interested they are .
that would have been okay .
i have a question .
you can go in .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
how do we know ?
because you know what ?
it &apos;s not a country .
why do we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
grind them .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it .
completely inefficient .
wonderful , huh ?
that &apos;s efficient .
there &apos;s nothing going on at all .
what a fish .
not very sustainable .
that &apos;s me .
incredibly exciting .
very different term .
they &apos;re all important .
it &apos;s essential .
so they meet al .
and she did .
thank you very much .
this was the result .
just do your job .
good work ! yes !
yeah , good afternoon .
they have similar principles .
that &apos;s our present .
yeah , milliseconds .
the whole environmental discussion .
what do you then say ?
we can do that .
all of this is what i &apos;m interested in .
lento , slowly .
yeah , good afternoon .
it &apos;s already done .
that &apos;s the system .
robert gupta .
what did they do ?
the farm is incredible .
can i be honest ?
that was fascinating .
that &apos;s terribly important .
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
okay . thank you very much .
but you know what ?
pretty good , right ?
yeah , i know .
there &apos;s no normal thing .
oh , so he is .
that &apos;s very good .
a few more .
he opens the door .
why no longer live ?
it has sensors .
here &apos;s the video .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
it &apos;s generic .
i was amazed .
ban is blank .
but you know what ?
what happened here ?
centers have been built up .
i don &apos;t know .
and that &apos;s important .
you reevaluate them .
hey , why not ?
1,000 , very good .
what happened here ?
these people make money .
these days are over .
can we change it ?
this is the last one .
flying cat .
yeah , that &apos;s it .
what is media today ?
we can do it differently .
and it has to go back .
not guilt management .
let &apos;s call him don .
and i was an artist .
that &apos;s a wish .
bg : thank you .
no hospital either .
thank you .
stephen watts .
three out of 10 .
this was incredible .
thank you . thank you .
yeah , so to speak .
the only chance .
long , yeah .
fantastic , right ?
the sun rises .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we &apos;re going to take off .
where is it going ?
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we lose them .
i don &apos;t know .
i can help .
a lot .
does that sound good ?
it &apos;s terrible .
he had the experience .
that &apos;s not for emotions .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
now , what do you think happened ?
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
first , we have the population .
i don &apos;t like that question .
but what do your fish eat ?
let &apos;s also call it don .
this is preconceived .
the interpret work .
but where are we useful ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
how do we actually work for people ?
... invent his own story .
thank you .
you actually hurt .
why should we do that ?
thank you for listening .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
i wonder .
i swear it .
it feels great .
i represent children .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;m a writer .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
but the wrong things .
it &apos;s against justice .
there &apos;s no food .
an enormous challenge .
and i understand that .
people were playing crazy .
the data came in .
but it didn &apos;t .
maybe 10 times as many .
be a mentor .
thank you very much .
here you see it .
but it gets worse .
jk : both .
be the camera .
yeah . all right .
i created one .
first of all , narrow .
after just one journey there .
my gut feeling again .
what creates the illusion ?
and it was .
very expensive real estate .
and i always had that .
does anybody see anything particular ?
give pee a chance .
but that &apos;s not a protection .
fortunately , not , yes ?
in china , it was different .
you compare it .
i mean , the soul .
what would all it have to be done ?
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
and this is pretty amazing .
and why is that ?
i &apos;ll agree with you all .
yes , here it is .
the game is from 2007 .
there &apos;s an old study .
dk : 60,000 .
i think , rather than that .
some people have come and left .
ooh , thank you .
am i going to like the color ?
good afternoon , all together .
here you see the city .
he liked it very much .
they did secretly .
and it got even better .
it &apos;s an almost identical structure .
is that your opinion ?
that &apos;s a great question .
it keeps you fresh .
that &apos;s a great question .
my name is amit .
just keep on . lots of fun .
the answer to that is no .
okay , a few more .
let me wrap up .
there were remixes .
and then it became international .
uhhh .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
is it even photography ?
here &apos;s another example .
there &apos;s something else .
did you see these guys ?
it has billions of them .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it would be intolerable .
crisis . death . disaster .
and a lot of people forget this .
i felt really good .
and then it happened again .
he was always showing up here .
they were still fish .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
privacy must have been given .
now , what does that mean ?
so , what does that mean ?
don &apos;t be disheartened .
you see it immediately .
not toxic in it .
but i kept working .
or before bombs .
i &apos;m going in here .
there are two choices .
we need energy miracles .
why does this happen at all ?
oh . a moment .
i want to tell you .
what do you want to do ?
this is what &apos;s happening to us today .
and i kept working .
so she was back .
here &apos;s an example .
one place is south korea .
it was a huge success .
so they saw something magical .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
you can &apos;t be a problem .
they always say , why ?
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it was just not invented yet .
so let &apos;s have a walk .
does anybody know what that is ?
for example , this perception in context .
this is a game for the outside .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
is that reasonable ?
so let me remind you .
the answer is no .
and it &apos;s the crux .
sometimes i push too much .
but they do the job .
they connected these two people .
her mother pulled her on her own .
okay , there are a few .
think about your own decisions .
this picture is from this place .
i see this plussian sign .
and it took 18 months .
tell me about the world .
this is very risky .
and that worked very well .
but it was very sad .
that was the beginning of the journey .
i was struck by awe .
and then everybody went down .
they saw the big impact .
first extension , second extension .
well , i was the next one .
honestly , who &apos;s normal ?
and finally , epic meaning .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
the same thing , just bigger .
who is the most successful one ?
they want to feed the world ?
i wanted to support them .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
i only loved two .
thank you for your attention .
again , here you have it again .
this is such a natural thing .
she told me .
very scary .
transferred technology .
they called me up .
but i felt worse .
they really loved it .
the orange tractor .
what actually happened there ?
and then they set them up .
this is how it works .
but the key thing is ...
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
how about fitness ?
these changes are coming .
so that &apos;s the good news .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
the answer is yes .
they could have done better .
like that , you know .
what is this thing ?
this is what happened for christmas .
so why hack now ?
so it &apos;s n circle .
does that make you curious ?
because you can train that .
and how did that feel ?
we no longer produce ourselves .
i can say anything .
what is the soul ?
what else can we do ?
this is what the chart looked like .
i &apos;ll come to the end .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
it might sound evil .
we were 20 people .
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bones .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
conflict produces creativity .
so what do we need to do ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
this is felix .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
he went up and down .
we love technology and creativity .
it would be conscience .
we &apos;re constantly bumping each other .
and this opens up a map .
but what do we do with it ?
that &apos;s it , for example .
what do i look at ?
his name is tempt .
will it be my size ?
this sounds crazy , right ?
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
we need to spread the news .
that &apos;s what most of you know here .
you also have to understand that .
you can see that down there .
why not think about it that way ?
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the only country in the world .
i was devastated .
they then look like this .
is it about the light ?
i grew up in india .
that &apos;s the shorthand .
you can see the water coming .
i had a good life .
so what happened years after that ?
who are these relatives ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i want to ask you something .
that &apos;s what you feel like . &quot;
everybody &apos;s talking today about happiness .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
so , we can do that too .
how many people would choose creativity ?
is this all just education ?
now , how could this happen ?
play is not silly .
the data wasn &apos;t available before .
you can have this cloud .
she did it for three years .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the power plant can explode .
i may not say that .
they come from the artists .
he showed him jafour again .
they &apos;re all important opportunities . &quot;
well , then we want to .
what happened that day ?
the story is not over yet .
no , never been an opportunity .
sometimes perspective is the illusion .
how can we help you ? &quot;
but it &apos;s not so fast .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
it made me really sad .
it &apos;s not our burden .
and there &apos;s good news .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there are hundreds of them .
i learned everything memorized .
she was back and dying .
she shares her experiences with others .
my name is brian goldman .
he actually collected fish .
it was my first sunburn .
people were still happy .
let &apos;s be willii . &quot;
everybody needs a gold jar .
we depend on two countries .
and we &apos;re going to pick that up .
so not like detox .
when there &apos;s garbage right now .
an autistic student .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
and here &apos;s the picture again .
and of course , this is incredible treaties .
not very tasty either .
i almost never cook with it .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
what should our testimony look like ?
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
take nothing for granted .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
nobody has ever said that before .
the data shows this all the time .
they have so much uncertainty .
they create an epic story .
which one would you like the most ?
and this was 19 years ago .
play is not just child games .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
in the morning , before the game .
italy wins . yeah .
the entire building was water .
they can play with different species .
and then something funny happened .
what other brands are doing this ?
this is now one of the images .
they basically do the same thing .
and then we did .
we &apos;ve driven into an area .
it &apos;s it , very simple .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
today there are 2.3 million .
i talk a lot about these questions .
that was a grandiose .
the white lines represent population .
but , you know what ?
i started feeling better .
but there are two problems with this .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
and it was an incredible experience .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
so the question is : how ?
and we &apos;re too many of them .
every waste is nutrient .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
and you already have a problem .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
it just doesn &apos;t work technologically .
he pointed at the algae .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
what are the lessons we learned ?
this one has the biggest impact .
among them shouldn &apos;t suffer other things .
and then realizing him .
because does anybody here have masses ?
they become computers in the open .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
we all love baseball , right ?
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
my second mistake was worse .
once upon a time , we started a living .
okay , that &apos;s what makes you really courage .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
they can &apos;t store energy .
and the shape plays a role .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
we &apos;re not going to go further than that .
what are they trying to do ? &quot;
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
slowly but surely , it turned out .
it gets more and more like that .
because i can say anything .
this is all metadata .
we use the sun &apos;s energy .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
and it starts with a doctor .
maybe even in our cell phones .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
asked the nurse expertly .
today , everything is easy to have .
creativity had to sort of get out .
we started 15 years ago .
i &apos;d like to prove that to you .
it was a pretty fate project .
here he is leaving the sun .
this is for memory basins .
these rivers are taking them rapidly .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
next , nuclear energy .
this sounds frightening .
this is scary .
hmmm , my brand ?
leave that quietly .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
nullemissions , right ?
but we need that in general .
but it &apos;s all effective , right ?
the motivations of writing it .
now i tried something exciting .
dark urine . dark .
what &apos;s a story through ?
i remember my first fire .
just be who you are .
what else is risky ?
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
thank you very much for your patience .
her family gathered together .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
so you can do something from nothing .
do you want to save jeans with holes ?
the truth is more like this .
and that &apos;s at the very beginning .
anyway , not to navigate .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
so you can &apos;t solve this at all .
we say sustainability in germany .
how and what did he feel ?
because to me , it means memory .
this is like talking learning .
have you ever been envy ?
i &apos;m shooting through my head a little bit .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
and then we said , okay .
so i just started playing .
so the dynamic was really changed .
so , look what happens .
so the correlation is small .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
what about longevity ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
the game starts -- silence .
and this video is real time .
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is a child game , right ?
that made no sense in my eyes .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i like things that are different .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
all adults were aware of the risks .
it &apos;s spreading rapidly .
it can know where we are .
why did i go to medicine ?
it &apos;s not documented .
they sell certificates .
and there are several reasons for this .
and what does that mean for the designer ?
sunlight and co2 are a method .
i think they &apos;re disgusting .
this picture reminded me of something .
the book and the picture .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
we can regain our nutrients .
now this is the minimum .
you can show , i was there .
when you get there , right ?
that has to be the difference in aging .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
so the first step to interpretation .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
how far do you even get there ?
music is medicine . music changes us .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
they flew the channels .
i &apos;ll stop there , thank you very much .
i could draw . i could paint .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
anyway , we need a solution .
there &apos;s another reason .
and that can make a big difference .
this has nothing to do with science .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
five million people use it every month .
but what will come in the future ?
these will be inconsistent .
and you know what i learned ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
do we really want to go this way ?
you can do that all the time .
but the truth is far from it .
he can only use his eyes .
i really like beautiful clothing .
you see something fun here .
it seemed to be pretty popular .
this is a picture of the object .
so we measured his movement .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
something was spreading inside of me .
oh , my time has been over ?
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
and these are the neural structures .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
because we live on a water planet .
baseball is full of great statistics .
i &apos;m not going to take the same course .
i &apos;m the newly defined doctor .
they had been genetically squeezed .
privacy is not a debate .
lego made it possible for all of you .
our magazines are read by millions .
a has these benefits and risks .
i &apos;m going to show you that now .
as soon as the judge saw me .
we can &apos;t just do that .
so i went to the court .
i got a little scared of technology .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
what do you think happens next ?
they have them . they always have them .
so this is a tough nut .
it &apos;s gone up constant .
they literally moved the lever .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
especially when he &apos;s already died .
so there are two cycles that emerge .
the byproduct is clean water .
this sounds kind of unusual first .
we have unique elements in here .
you always lose rare animals .
it will deeply touch you .
he died , broken by history .
fully targeted a particular destination .
here &apos;s how the building works .
they drilled through each other .
say what you feel .
and i had to get out of town .
okay , you really want to know ?
this was more to emphasize .
you want to orient in the museum ?
but then you really want to go deep .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
here &apos;s your marmelting gang .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
we need to slowly increase complexity .
for one year , we didn &apos;t have a dime .
her father died shortly after her birth .
the defeat would have been too simple .
who would ever want one wish ?
but it requires a lot of planning .
and i jumped on it every morning .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
i learned this from my grandmother .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
i started my usual talk .
it &apos;s about changing standards .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
the stones are colored .
longer than these other two networks .
often in the third then , already forgot .
and it &apos;s related to phosphorus .
in how we think from the north .
we can reinvent everything again .
i started an institute on this .
that &apos;s how natural things are presented .
automatically , it &apos;s going to be the right thought .
the names of the project today .
it &apos;s about insanity .
simple , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to happen .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
and that &apos;s what got me wrong ...
this is ideology , not science .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
i call this the radiant tiger .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
we need to think about what brands are .
the film was not delivered yet .
they even bring in funding .
it makes leukemia in kids .
who do you actually want to inform with it ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who could have looked like this ?
i talked a lot about magic .
these are the apsaras .
my brother stared at me .
this may be broadcast publicly .
we &apos;ve already got a lot of procedures going .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
bjordn sundin .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
and everybody in this room has to go in .
the result was catastrophic .
happy productivity . fantastic !
we &apos;ve reached some kind of balance .
thank you , but the best part is still coming .
they gave their blood pressure increase .
the living gave birth to the spirits .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes .
people over the urine .
asking , what &apos;s the right thing to do ?
there are also world record .
if you haven &apos;t heard it .
what words would you describe as ban ?
they add very well .
that &apos;s over 250 thousand acres .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
and nobody seems to upset about that .
all of these generations take just a few milliseconds to do .
i tried to understand them .
this is what i came up with for energy .
and here you feel it already .
these things are logically correct .
students are divided after grades .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
they &apos;re interested in fire .
there he is signing up .
here you have this little mechanism .
let &apos;s make a little intermediate .
we won some awards .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier kids ?
so this crazy story could be true .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
then we get all this positive feedback .
no , i &apos;m really serious about it .
i hold the knife in my hand .
and the goal here is very simple .
i push my sleeve back .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
now i see greg lemond .
one billion people will starve today .
do they do it for the kids ? &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , no , no , it &apos;s not .
and this sounds very different from before .
he was already over his sixties .
here &apos;s the olive oil aisle .
odds are simply in our lives .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
let &apos;s start to perceive .
it turns off the engines .
... so , not so optimistic .
you brought your pictures with you , right ?
i think that &apos;s really cool .
politely , everybody applauded .
now we saw the reverse effect .
he moved back to silence .
so i followed my gut feeling .
we worked until late at night .
so scott gets this fruit .
lead perhaps some mutations .
they kept us inspired by being inspired .
i represent people in death cells .
i &apos;d written these crazy things .
now look at this curve .
we go through initiation rituals .
they &apos;re somebody &apos;s home countries .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re all answering questions .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
we have to get far , fast .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
so from modern to computer society .
you &apos;ll see it from behind to front .
a dalmatiner , exactly .
this is also such a paradigm shift .
and the curiosity is not learning .
this is just a little less destruction .
so this is not what men can be pigs .
we can support them to be good .
we can support them to be good .
but with the right design , there we go .
the mechanism is from the lie .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
we also got very precise data .
this is going to happen in the next april .
he shook his head , no .
it was really profound .
we talk about it twin .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
i &apos;m going to read to you the post .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
the main man turned me on .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
they had a concept of blue blood .
and women argued this successfully .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
the roof was also covered in water .
this is a painting of a circle .
that &apos;s not the route , usually .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
we &apos;re talking about audacious , fresh .
how would you describe your brand ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
there was jimmy kimmy .
even cats look at this video .
i never met him personally .
i thought everybody could do that .
it may take a long time to get there .
something very strange is happening here .
you should wish some wishes as well .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
but i kept asking myself about these questions .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
i &apos;m a human being . i make mistakes .
she hadn &apos;t drowned yet .
but today we &apos;re way beyond that .
they tap into their internet connection .
156 nations send our channel to television .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
no , no , no , far missing .
maybe another look at it again .
to say alone , what is information ?
i see the dalmatiner .
what takes fifty milliseconds ?
the one that &apos;s just been shown .
that &apos;s such a proper part .
you put it like this , ne box .
the chef had cooked it .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
this is an ecological network .
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
and these sources also underlie disruptions .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what does it work ?
and even lomborg is thinking around .
there was never a time like this before .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
does anybody remember what that is ?
it &apos;s not even the truth that will set it free .
we have masses in this country now .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
and why ? genetically modified food .
the dosage also matters .
everybody would like to make people happier .
daniel kahneman : sure .
and there are lovely collaborators .
so the first exciting primate .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
these kinds of states don &apos;t exist with us .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
it &apos;s called &quot; jump with me . &quot;
so that &apos;s why this project is happening .
and that was the outbreak of it .
tempt is completely paralyzed today .
make it possible -- all of you here .
tell me a little bit about this part .
they can be logical and intuitive .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
and i &apos;d like to read them for you .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
i lived in parallel worlds .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let go of them . &quot;
the bank is from a different place .
this is a modest little app .
not only do boston have a call center .
so it creates a feedback .
it can know how to hold it .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
you say there are no predictors .
can you play them in blue now ?
no , we find out what &apos;s in there .
and there &apos;s a central point about this .
you know , everybody &apos;s eaten pies .
that &apos;s what it says more like to the norm .
what are archaic models now ?
and you can continue the list endlessly .
so , that was my primary motivation .
new america . find out more .
and the problem is not technology itself .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we asked around , and nobody knew .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
monday : color is something that &apos;s powerful .
if you burn coal , no .
it &apos;s sort of wired us up .
and then it usually looks like this .
do you remember the winds again ?
so , help me with this a little bit .
imagine mozart being efficient .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m there .
the waters have been expanding .
they make it worse for us to get there .
man 3 : i &apos;m the guy of the museum .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
or take a lip pen .
now the instruments have moved on .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
you see the timeline up at the top .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
a whole cool whip of whip food .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i have it here on my laptop . &quot;
now who &apos;s ready for this journey .
here are two different dirty facilities .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
my cousins were running around everywhere .
a lot of my clients are very young .
i think our identity is threatened .
do you want to come in and listen ? &quot;
alone , shameful and without support .
what you need is a new medical culture .
it was a grouper .
a language is a expression of the human mind .
let &apos;s get something else out of it now .
yeah . it doesn &apos;t matter anything but discovering .
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a minute .
shake the environment , make less waste .
it should contain the two elements again .
this is just an insurance method .
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
he &apos;d had 20 minutes of glorious music .
thank you . i have a question for you .
but the game is a formal transducer .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
and anyway , italy won at the end of it .
this is roberto dancing .
as an artist , i think the context is very important .
ordinary people are not available to these devices . &quot;
it &apos;s all coming from our own pockets .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
i &apos;m tired , like all of us .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
but western governments also help themselves .
this is my supermarket . this is not a big one .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
this is one , part of it .
and green , it was a disaster .
this really solves the fuel problem .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
this is just working titles , by the way .
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
the difference is then seen as a loss .
and on , now you see him all the time .
no tree is carbon neutral .
so basically , a translation of the translation .
so what can we do from all of this ?
isn &apos;t it enough half or a quarter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
what are the measures i &apos;m calling for ?
you can predict that . why is that happening ?
she was the daughter of a slave family .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
so far , this has been a problem for supercomputers .
there are a lot of great books on this subject .
no insurance can be crossed .
the emergency staff pulled all the strands .
in two hours , it builds up everywhere .
i want to explain that a little bit for a second .
three paragraph you still know from school .
in that three-sentence , three sentences appear .
in fact , don &apos;t want to make a viral video .
thank you , danny kahneman .
we get an absolutely flat line about that .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
you run the process , you understand it .
there &apos;s some stuff that has to come together .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
bad ? i was completely confused .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
because now you can apply a three-set .
and then he can walk away .
a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
his personal impressions of the seerosis .
i &apos;m going to try this through an example .
he &apos;s only going to have to process that as a present .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
this is an annual flow of water .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
so littlebits are open source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
they grow up to be five centimeters .
maybe i did it with good reason .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
the next step has now happened within these communities .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
so , that really blew my mind .
if you burn natural gas , no .
they know that science is not a company .
and let them start with an example .
people suffered . people fought .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
maybe we can see odds as a change .
raise your hands . let me see .
just imagine that for a moment .
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
second half-time . end of the normal play time .
that means something built in the city .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
you go around and you amuse yourself .
you can zoom in and zoom out very easily .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . thank you .
we think of energy scarcity today .
i call it &quot; the next billion . &quot;
it &apos;s a game called foldon .
let me show you how they work .
you just listen and start talking .
official dogma of what ?
three , escalation of expectations .
your problem is they have too little .
they laughed more than you do here .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
if not , squawks today , somebody else .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
now i &apos;m adding a bass .
now if you think a little bit further , right ?
and the last two are also here today .
now you &apos;re looking at the dalmatiner .
this is what &apos;s called the osit-model .
shake the environment , consume less energy .
because this is what lights up with , right ?
you can immerse yourself in a particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular issue .
we &apos;re talking about drowning into information .
it &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
and there &apos;s the problems of storage .
my parents are in the heel 80 .
we forced them . phew .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we reject genetically engineered food .
what ? that really freaked me out .
i tried to keep the body in mind .
i wanted to restore the health after a disease .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
they &apos;re in the back of our bodies .
donnerday : confidence is the key .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
it was something we knew to do .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
it captures a thousand square miles .
third technology : categorization .
my fourth technique : requirement for complexity .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
but so many got help over the years .
life had not changed for centuries .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and let me show you a simple example .
i work in solar technology .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
well , i entered the courtroom .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
i remember it was yesterday .
the three words say , remember ?
we still think they &apos;re primal .
i thought i could integrate .
so this is what the supermarket is like .
here &apos;s some of the hamptons .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
seriously , the bottom line is refused !
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
and if not , still dance your dance .
the permanent ice is labeled with red .
anyway , they do it in there .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
this is balanced in china in a second .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s in there that &apos;s useful .
all of them are composable .
and yes , i &apos;ll go back one more slide .
our goal was to just say , okay .
and in time , you can react to other people .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
i didn &apos;t discourage myself of that .
this has to be down to zero .
the internet and service is a miracle .
we need to stand up for more research .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
they were just like the people in this room .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
shame . shameful .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
let me show you from near it .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
what we want to do is create the future .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
so put it there ; save the shoes .
intersexuality occurs in many different forms .
so that made sense , it fit together .
so again , this fit really well .
so this is where we need digital security systems .
and this is a million companies .
eeeeeeee ! no , thank you .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
i think i may have heard more hands .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
nobody has to give their ideas green light .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
is this the detail or the colors ?
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here , every piece is very well-planned .
scott was talking about man to human beings .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
yet we seem to be quite happy with this .
anyway , i definitely want that .
technical cycles are the same .
what would you tell someone who believed that ?
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that too .
and this is very important in medical research .
there can be a order of change .
this is alfred gonzalez .
what do you do with certificates ?
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t put them wrong .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
at first we just signed .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
and they had to remove what we were doing .
you &apos;re all back on your way back now .
now i &apos;m going to do some more drums about this .
that the theme of ecology is a global subject .
there &apos;s every footprint disadvantaged there .
picasso says , wait a minute .
no one in the world has ever done this yet .
natural light then offers the smart grid .
what &apos;s the food waste ? &quot;
every morning they fly to the farm for 2,000 miles .
and every night they fly back 240 kilometers .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government now .
i was totally passionate about science , you know .
they live with chemosynthesis help .
this becomes a key element of this testimony .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
we pretend we have a machine here .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back who had no childhood .
i would usually take the needle out now .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
ladies and gentlemen , their relationships .
so two couples , each one is a baby .
so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
so i think we need to be leaders .
on the left you see a little boat .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
nobody wanted to have anything to do with the movie .
these things have a more positive effect .
it &apos;s the way i &apos;d like to be .
the first is a classic , apple .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the performance .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
they &apos;re delocated the rest of the time .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
she &apos;s got a button , on / off .
next week , this is what comes to the market .
today , a lot of people have given up with the government .
and try the whole thing again with another generation .
storytelling needs more and more senses .
first of all , i thought this was a game .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
and we are increasing our expectations all the time .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
and i went back to work .
the question is , why do people accept this ?
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask important questions .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
i said , &quot; great , &quot; i said .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
they don &apos;t spend time in power fighting .
what happened was we could do that .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of masses .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
it was summer , and i had shorts on it .
and of course , it did click .
i want to show you something first here .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers walk down .
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
i never want to move anything in life anymore .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
it hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
the best part is -- in a second .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
that our contribution to the system is the choice .
at 16 , i started illustrating books .
my mother was the youngest of her ten children .
and i have to say , it gave me power .
notice two things in this curve .
do you know what &apos;s called a 4,000-person ?
i put them on and i took them on treatment .
it supports others talking about their mistakes .
and this argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and everything is packaging or content .
so saving , cutting , avoiding , avoiding .
so every concert is a different concert .
so smart-grid , a huge topic everywhere .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
i &apos;ve summarized the last three of the five .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
and i say that &apos;s good .
it came from four and a half years ago in italy .
and we still need to improve a lot of this device .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
and it still keeps a realistic level .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
there are some very interesting developments .
we want to do something about the death penalty .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
and we want to make this material available to all of them .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
which would roll across the country on them .
i &apos;m really sorry . does this crazy ?
but it &apos;s definitely not an optical situation .
all of them were like this started to divide .
he came up to me and hugged me .
now everybody in this pattern is trying to see something .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you for a moment .
it was a lot of go and i was in a hurry .
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we invent it .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to the human .
come with me , dance . thank you .
at first , tribal society through language .
i highlighted it especially here .
then he whispered in my ear .
for example , the sneaker , right ?
this is a dead turtle .
everyone on my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
this is a completely unsustainable development pattern .
you seem to have seen it in the news .
and in that head , the memory was going on .
we understood that the weather is global .
and what &apos;s it actually looking like in there ?
in the countries where people come to money .
so , we can &apos;t make these things happen at all .
they &apos;ve converted the flow of water around .
and that was incredibly exciting to me .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
how about living longer in good health ?
i have something here that i want to show you .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
store them off , wipe the rest off .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
the only thing they had was their head .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
these diapers are all around , almost .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can do it .
so that was a highly strange experience .
did you all take your vitamins this morning ?
there were no cantaloupe-melon .
as i said , amanda is carrying our elephant .
they &apos;re survival , both of them are light .
i want to help you calm down .
all right , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
and this is what these brands did .
because it doesn &apos;t really feel like we &apos;re feeling money .
no apple ever tasted that way again .
i was not familiar with the label .
but what happens to citizens is different .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
the sign of dna was an interesting step .
the silence is ear anesthetizing .
we want to lower the number of prisoners .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
and to give feedback to my upper doctor .
one thought i had kidney stones .
the corporate headquarters are right here .
there are those that are much more spatial .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
here are a couple of people who test it .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and we see that it works through .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficiently ?
not to be composable , of course .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
but maybe you can still reverse them .
these were the very first calculations , six years ago .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
i think the first thing is curiosity .
this is what the u.s. for hundreds of years is doing .
now they understood the advantage of prototyping .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
we &apos;ve done it over the last 11,000 years .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
but how do you do that in practice ?
here are the results we just got .
so that they can understand the whole movement .
this is something like our cry .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
do you know how many people watch these tedtalks ?
the answer will be highly likely to be no .
they wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with the project .
we found that it &apos;s really moving strange .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i told my mother i was not going to do that .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i put my job at 95 pounds .
good night , sweet marsupial rat . &quot;
so each droplet was a little different .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
and i become a character in the book .
i remember it was yesterday .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
all of this together are inevitable errors .
so you don &apos;t often lose animals that are coming .
they get rarer because we catch them .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but decrease is not always such a bad thing .
this is pictures over a period of six seconds .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
if your job is to dance , dance .
and they also feel their movements and tilt .
now he &apos;s going to take a tractor into the scene .
i can put the sequence as it runs out .
or they didn &apos;t have photoolitography .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
it &apos;s about a behavior poop , in a sense .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
interpretation is barely spoken in the beginning class .
design a phrase with its own breath .
why do i have to afford little car like this ?
he &apos;s just deceiving you and not himself .
because without that lifespan , we can &apos;t live without .
because in fact , this person is not interested in evidence at all .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have it anymore ?
well , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
for nathaniel , music means mental health .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
these silly movies don &apos;t bring us money .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
the marshmallow must be on top .
well , i understand that . i do that .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
yeah , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
probably many of you in this room know this trick .
... that the doses also matter .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
this is not about how happy a person lives .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
you see , dr. kean changed his thinking .
how could it be possible that we do that ?
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
i want to tell you how we figured that out .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
so how accurate are we going to see in the movie ?
what &apos;s next thing you want to talk about .
or are they more like a down attribute ?
this is just online -- no press , no television .
and finally , if we welcome transparency , we should welcome transparency .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
and all of this leads us to the one big question ...
i made a decision to move to the united states .
and that worked . applause for scott .
and in this case , it was a neighbor .
and we use that word with that kind of contempt .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
she had the last word in every family argument .
wealth , not debt , affects outcomes .
well , really good , maybe a star star .
i was a obsessively obsessional student .
and it wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to do .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
and the world we lived in looked like this .
well , what kind of projects do we actually do now ?
they virtualize reality without computers .
from the avian age to the machine age .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
i had a relationship with that beauty for several months .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
so my two passions sort of intertwined .
and so i made a slightly unusual decision then .
that &apos;s where a connection comes from , a mutual respect .
i thought we &apos;d bring the poker &apos;s use in a moment .
but you know what they &apos;re wrong with ?
but one of them is far worse than the other .
you expect one more billion players in the next decade .
so we have a billion and a half billion players in total .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
but are we going to do the best we can out of our play drive ?
we see the same thing with the disabled legal movement .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
it &apos;s nateness , and it &apos;s just nateness .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
emc : &quot; welcome transparency . &quot;
here we were , and this is the painting .
well , let me show you a little bit more of it .
you know , it was a trick , right ?
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
this is the call center for service and information .
now we &apos;re doing this with drillers and machines .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
we want to eliminate mass incarceration . &quot;
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
we have a passion of a diy innovator .
she was barely breathing , and she was blue .
that &apos;s the kind of educational shame .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a great loss .
if you want to create them hyperlinks between the images .
do you know what the answer to that question is ?
i have maybe another 40 years of work in me .
we wanted to develop a language learner &apos;s learning .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
but you won &apos;t be able to replace phosphorus .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
so we &apos;re going away from that , and where are we going ?
and some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t work .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them that .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
people in the side rooms are now coming in .
i &apos;ll agree first , that &apos;s logical .
do you want to get more attractive and confident ?
the dog ! i was linguistic .
tuesday : adaptation is totally overrated .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
a little bit more about you , not you .
and what was that for you ? what was it successful ?
right now , we &apos;re far from that goal .
when i say reality , i mean photo-reality .
the underwater part comes from a quarry .
today i &apos;m going to report the unexpected discoveries .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
the kid in me is really excited about these opportunities .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
i think it seems important to me to unite both .
there &apos;s a program that some people may know already .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
and we &apos;re inventing ourselves as often as we want .
then i say , heart suffering , right ?
have a nice example of this .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement on reality .
the main problem here is something like aids .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
and that &apos;s the same thing after the three months .
we see this in all sorts of different parts of human life .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to borders anymore .
these are the people who shape my worldview .
my mother suffered from the boat in nightmares .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the possibilities of this yet .
you know , it was here in 1835 .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and fortunately , there &apos;s also a lot of studies to do that now .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
this player is standing in front of an epic victory .
these results have been achieved through several weeks of hard work .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
it turns out it &apos;s in other places in the book .
and i went over and i just listened .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the helpful doctor .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
likewise , i think we &apos;re using games today .
... if you could just show the slide for a second .
you can say things here that have a global impact .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
i think that &apos;s true for every human on the planet .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and do you know what my answer to all of this is ?
we &apos;re going into the arms of the placebo industry .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a point of what &apos;s true .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
so please listen when a music is played .
and that &apos;s the message , &apos; n little bit .
how many would choose to have good memory ?
imagine only two other small changes .
that &apos;s an idea worth spreading .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
so , pull it off and start inventing it .
go and squawk leonard cohen .
his whole process of work has changed afterwards .
and we can look at that now .
that means that the ants weigh a lot more than us .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so you could feel comfortable selling it .
it &apos;s hard to overestimate the destruction .
so my way of making films completely changed .
the second factor is the services we use .
so here are some natural fireflies .
because they have special skills of processing .
we called it the digital water pavilion .
there are some places we can turn to .
but what this picture is for is a problem .
the politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is changing .
they &apos;re obscure and strange programs .
i said , &quot; promises , oma . &quot;
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
every big picture is the beginning of a sniff .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to all of you .
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
then you &apos;ll notice that there was a change .
there &apos;s no overpopulation problem with trees .
&quot; look at your herbs , pink .
you have to be willing to take these risks .
we repeated that exercise with the same students .
and it took me a while to figure that out .
we didn &apos;t have child paralysis in this country yesterday .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
this is one of the classic expressions in playing .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
this is another view of the tree of life .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
they moved to a natural concept .
imagine a soundless airplane .
he says , &quot; willingness to jumble . &quot;
so we start with a windows drug .
and if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t matter .
think about it . this attack is generic .
how much money is needed to realize that ?
you can look around all these museums here .
you zoomed in . you can really go in .
look , let me give you an analogy .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
loans and sponsors were seeded .
and we created an ipad app .
so he got the citizens to check them .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
so these women met and just talked .
maniox is something that half a billion people eat .
child mortality has reduced by a tenth of a child mortality .
we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot;
but these are all the streets in the united states .
and the world we live in now looks like this .
we reconditioned them , we repaired them .
everybody knew your genius was a little bit lumpy .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
it grows in the winter and shrinks in the summer .
but volume is much bigger than ever before .
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website here .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for you .
those who make scientific argument are very little .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
they teach them to open up themselves doors .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
if you have something to give , give it to you now .
play is the tickling that keeps us together .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
they can move inside and have different kinds of experiences .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and much more aggressive .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to face .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
or are they more like a down attribute ?
i don &apos;t see a reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
they had 348 different kinds of martian .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
and i see the same process combining photographs .
so in other words , i define first what i want .
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
the grandfather of this old man refused .
you get a model that comes out of all of the earth .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built watermarks .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation &apos;s fuels .
and these interactive portraits take each other &apos;s notice .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
that &apos;s there , then that &apos;s coming back .
how can i make something possible using something friendly ?
and less usable or usable it is .
it &apos;s the form of refour behavior , right ?
i &apos;m never going to play anything like this anymore .
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned how to sing ?
and even , you work much less than i did .
because artists have a disrupted relationship to lying .
we returned to the titanic wreck .
and also , for them , the energy cycle is very important .
where is the greatest interest in doing this really ?
now this is not supposed to be a joke , but .
do that once , and then you learn the sentence .
we can continue these things in different examples .
what we stayed is the story story story .
we actually know that something else is the case .
the living self has no voice in that choice .
i mean , i rarely saw that flat line .
you never get a job you can &apos;t solve .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
and these were kind of the first of people to develop toys .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open them up doors ?
and no , it &apos;s not touch man or san francisco .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
you can look great for almost always for less than 50 dollars .
zidane , in a moment of the head shock .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with that .
are they mindful and monsoon like 007 ?
we should put the bear in the cage .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and aware .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
this year , it was almost 50 million times looking at .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so the occupation movement has done it .
at one point , the screen is filled with leaves .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he described one of them as very &quot; typical . &quot;
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember that .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
i &apos;d rather continue to do this work that i love .
and everybody knew it worked that way , right ?
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway , because that &apos;s my job .
and touch ol√© ! pass for you despite all of that .
this is an interactive trickwatch .
as i said , two-thousand-odd , it just started .
there it becomes more of my glasses already .
because we &apos;re not doing things more freely from us .
in fact , the notes are very vague and inaccurate .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
but for a lot of people , that &apos;s a little too radical .
with pivot , you can immerse in a decade .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t impose yourself .
bg : a breakthrough of energy is the most important .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
the biggest difference between them is the treatment of time .
we &apos;re now spending three billion hours a week playing online games .
edward castronova is a economist .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world-changing games !
is it fun for others or is it affecting us ?
he steel every five kiss of hope from my consciousness .
well , chimps are known for their aggressive .
how do you judge people because of their characteristics ?
france makes a gate . italy makes a gate .
well , today we know all about where our things come from .
well , we introduced the mayor belhole .
how would you change your relationships , and the negative energy in that ?
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
well , in this area , there aren &apos;t several thousand targets .
and the movie is called &quot; the performance performance performance ever . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great jets .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not streaming .
also urban designers and construction are very interested .
she &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bribe .
&quot; don &apos;t go , &quot; it turned out to be untrue .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacines .
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s where the digital hits the physical .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
the cell communities started to abstract information again .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
but i really think there &apos;s something else coming after us .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculously listening .
now it &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
in the future , most crimes will be online .
and the question is , are they good news or bad news ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this goldfish glass . &quot;
i &apos;m going to resolve what &apos;s inside as well .
a research semester on natural user interface design .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
which other metamorphosis have you gone through ?
so you just go to googleproject.com .
we know another one where all the gas stations are .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
in both cases , they worked well , they did well .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
no , throwing that away is exactly the right thing , right ?
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
this is my meat , and i can turn this around .
i sell museum animals all over the country , all over the world .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle there .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
now , how do people die in the wake of such a hack ?
these are rooms that intelligent can respond to a human being .
that &apos;s why thinking from weighs to weighs .
a manhattan project ? how do we get there ?
one m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife like this in my axe .
that &apos;s not how it works at all for the memory itself .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to that .
both cases stopped me , ask me .
i can &apos;t play today as much as i do in 20 years .
that &apos;s the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
so when cloning says there are no soul .
i was obsessed with studying the deep sea .
many people talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
we were only sildating around there like we used to .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always doing things the same .
that &apos;s our goal right now , largely .
when we start thinking about it that way , it changes everything .
as a child , i was always drawing comic books and so on .
in the course of that voyage of discovery , i learned a lot .
this is starlight night , probably never seen this before .
our steps in digitization of life were exponential .
it caused immense jupiter in the control room .
we have an abstract language . we have an abstract language .
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer brand .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambition .
for the bottom two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
and of course , also , how design affects perception .
so how does a human being deal with certain things like this ?
that means that we &apos;re going back to crime .
and he was shooting and saying , right ?
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
i worked in a coal mining -- dangerous .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
... it gets crowdsourced to crowdsource .
she could happen within a time-learning framework .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disconnection .
they interfered them to the beating machine .
she had suffered a non-treatable brain damage .
meanwhile , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
it happened to be the genital machine age .
as it used to happen on the village .
all that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
ask questions , ask them the evidence , demand them .
i know what people think when they see that , i know what they think .
ok , imagine this as extreme self-motivating .
but we know very little about where things go .
there &apos;s more to it , it &apos;s even deeper .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
it was the misguided cruise against drugs .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
and the fish were also fortunate to be there .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
frosty , the carbon man gets cleaner every day .
america &apos;s new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
there &apos;s exactly what i just described .
have you ever seen a climate-neutral tree ?
because , you know , this is a fun process .
i wasn &apos;t there long ago with miguel .
this was not a film , no hd , this was real .
in fact , progress society is based on energy advances .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
and this is actually a conservative estimate .
but it was actually a lot of fun that night .
the idea is to overlist a digital security system .
moment , and wham , you &apos;re at this museum .
because the images made it feel more real for them .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
but you can combine something special like this .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
marsupial rat ? yes . alive ? yap .
we see the process that feeds itself .
it doesn &apos;t slow down for any of our big problems .
he took a famous photograph . what did it mean ?
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to want ?
well , because they don &apos;t know it was once different .
diginotar is a certification site .
it was called the automatically bonding stone .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
that &apos;s already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
so i know of some who haven &apos;t contributed .
a baby needs about six diapers .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
he lived only nine years .
because the musical instrument is the extension of our bodies .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the &apos; 60s .
and then they did a whole bunch of simulations .
and so he escapes its tormented state .
shrimp eats the phytoplankton .
it &apos;s this fun , charged taste .
he said , &quot; the skin seems like a sponge .
this is not an ad , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
so i take a step back , and i take a look at it .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
well , the energy cycle has fallen over time .
this is a variant of one thing that was done .
diphtery , roteln , child paralysis ...
you can just call some names and people will understand .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
in other words , play is our adaptation joker .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
when we make cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
i filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
but what if you want to see the paintbrush strikes ?
but what &apos;s the trick it makes it look realistic ?
as you can see , these are not three special images .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
so , in a way , we overwhelm technology .
she was a keyboard , strong woman , she had an impact .
my grandfather was in prison during the prohibition .
the brochures still describe them as untouched .
a few years ago , i started developing littlebits .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
why are they advertising around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to ever change .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
and the predictions that you &apos;ve read are serious .
and i think technology is becoming more and more important in our modern societies .
and even today , we still depend very , very hard on stories .
this is the period in which you fall in love .
and as we get older , the diapers get bigger .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound record .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality .
and my talk today is going to be mostly about these cognitive failures .
i mean , how much do we consume of our memories ?
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
these are the kinds of questions we need to be facing .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
imagine if these imagery could really start flying .
a friend of mine did it -- richard bollingness &apos;s license .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transparency right now .
open up the map , and jump with a click .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
you &apos;re always worried that you lose legal space .
ohhhhhhhhhhhhh , what www !
if one neighbor helps the other , we empower our communities .
call the animal beginner , it costs a lot of money .
what &apos;s this new state that the world is starting to take on ?
in fact , we &apos;re also such a multi-cellular community .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
my uncle died of alcohol induced diseases .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to advance injustice .
this is chesapeake bay simulation .
we also brought littlebits to design schools .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdressing for a second .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
i &apos;m not good enough , i can &apos;t do it . i can &apos;t do it .
and we &apos;re going to be able to replace the oil with other energy carriers .
and what you would think of today in the spirit as well .
and then i immediately come in , which is unfair .
so the more pink the belly the system is better . &quot;
i mentioned this to miguel , and he was nodding .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also the flavor experts .
so there should be a nine in the beginning of my death .
this is a lot of deaths through masses , 20 hours per hour .
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
but it turns out that this is not all .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy that . thank you very much .
the more money you make , the happier you are .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
it &apos;s only that i think it likes it , right ?
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
and the film is going to be called , &quot; the performance performance performance . &quot;
you &apos;ll see the whole thing going on in the movie of stats .
i have that . the first picture is a picture of my family .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , this sounds interesting . &quot;
for example , this would be somebody who is completely logical .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
secondly , combined photos should have the same lighting .
and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize .
right , bryan , the judge has forces .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a break .
that our entire survival is connected to every single one of us .
we have the capital of the techno-philanthropy .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
but you can do it if you &apos;re in a foreign extraterrestrial .
somewhere here , there are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is the publication we just recently completed .
this is equivalent to 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
we moved to what was called the avian age before .
i can say the canadian is a man .
it has a 15 to one food delay .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
a very concrete wish that we &apos;ll invent this technology .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
well , your living self will not get happier .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anyone in this audience .
since that time , we &apos;ve received all sorts of recognition .
this approach to everything new we do in a creative way .
it was completely excluded that she could fail there .
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding it this morning , &quot; he said .
and they shine the light through the rest of the book .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justice system .
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 if a bat beat 300 .
and all the time , i collected more and more knowledge .
i studied women , and she was in respiratory .
and this was the first time i learned this myself .
i now know it was the bottom of the sea .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
we &apos;ve been in holland for three years now .
that &apos;s why not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
yeah , this is what one of the things that &apos;s down there , is the load .
and immediately i see another pattern that comes out .
so this really upset me , and i wanted to do more .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about us .
you know , there were no mandarins in paradise .
you can do this trick to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
they &apos;re clearly interacting with their environment and their experiences .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have the time .
each of these topics was , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
and this video had actually been sent in january .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
even if you kill someone , it &apos;s not just a murderer .
a few months went over , and i had just forgotten everything .
depending on his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
one consequence was that the telephone was never broken .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
so people in the west have really thought about creativity for a long time .
and all of a sudden , he no longer appeared to be human .
so from the same bad team , one of the best .
how can we transmit these feelings from games into reality ?
players are masters in dense social nets .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit in my tiny suitcase .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell you .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to get more efficient .
and of course , in germany , she can &apos;t be there anymore . &quot;
this is all of you in the forward phase , in a sense .
well , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
my great-grandparents all died when they were 60 .
and i don &apos;t mean just less successful , even though that &apos;s part of it .
or do they want to be fitter , stronger , have more power .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a moment .
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
the words , as long as his friends did , are now mocking his .
and we found that there was actually a relationship .
do you know how many decisions do you make on a typical day ?
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
so the driving force behind that is cyberpower .
i no longer argued with my wife for two years .
the pilot sent the machine out after the hudson river .
they can throw them away where they go and stand .
there &apos;s only the second best part , the fire department .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
welcome fear . welcome risk .
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
they did it by dewatering the country .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
so the device you see there didn &apos;t work .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
the things that are only used are going into technical systems .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
are you here ? you look a little nervous .
it was a store called a draeger &apos;s .
so , if you could turn on the light again .
then let &apos;s project this analogy into the future .
we &apos;ve just passed the seven-billion-dollar tag .
so it hasn &apos;t changed anything , and yet everything has changed .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
second , what economists call oppertunisia costs .
i apologize that i have to cut so much .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is looking .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
one of the things that &apos;s beautiful about life is not efficient .
there &apos;s a direct renaming system for this .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
that &apos;s already losing half his value in the first year .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of information flow .
and i talked to her to fund an expedition .
it has moments of life , one by one .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
i just wish i could see my children grow up .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned assembly language .
and what i noticed was that i needed an expert .
now , where would you place your brain at this scale ?
cats look at cats looking at this video .
and of course , we can find fast food chains .
the software funding typically takes a few years .
because that &apos;s where the actual government work is going on .
we need to rely on the government &apos;s machinery .
the cost of solar to go down by 50 percent last year .
i sent her home without talking to my supreme doctor .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
i believe in it , and i feel like we should teach that .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells good too .
how many doors do you have the house you live in ?
and other examples are the ambitious , intelligent systems .
but also our perception of ourselves , how it fails us .
that &apos;s why they help with it , they ask for people .
i play games explaining what these notes might have .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
and then we started negotiating with the insulanes .
&quot; 2.5 to one thing ? what do you feed ? &quot;
make it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and we shouldn &apos;t do that either . our healthcare system is mies .
there were no christmas trees . we did all of this .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
when we look at how feelings with the income vary .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready to play our own epic game .
again , what potential do we want to do now ?
which one would you like to have if you could only have one ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
when it didn &apos;t move , you &apos;ve buried it .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with me .
so they pull around and they make art installations like this .
the previous example was about finding details .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what &apos;s truly fantastic .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
a typical wal-mart offers them 100,000 products today .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something we do with it .
i knew she had come to pass .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes .
because her life depended on whether they did the job right .
because all of these new technologies of today are feeding on themselves .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
i went home through the emergency department .
i was shocked and moved into the inner .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
i started thinking , i should just trigger the project .
but i &apos;m just going to make it a little bit curious so far .
and first of all , to ask what &apos;s the right thing .
because the music is a language , and a language is a language to communicate there .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived them .
this first one , this was more like a passionate affair .
that second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
a fish lift , but also a bird reserve .
this is what happened . not one team had a stable structure .
there &apos;s a step-by-step manual there .
we &apos;re going to meet a few more times in the next few days .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
well , the memory itself is a storyteller .
we think about our future as a foreseeable memories .
we know money is very important , targets are very important .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not that sure .
most of my activities , i have two hats on them .
you see the person wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
that keeps us at the pole and keeps us evolving .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
i want to present to you two , maybe three examples as well .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually becoming witnesses of a rolling iceberg .
this is somebody who , by the way , meets four out of 10 .
we used to know that things happen linearly .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boy as a mandate .
in it they are , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
and then people could eat this , and they wouldn &apos;t get blind .
an amazing error rate . one out of nine innocent .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
we have lots of cells that are no longer put on their own .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
it was the fear of terror that formed her life .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
yet , we &apos;re still getting into the galapagos .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very quick .
but they don &apos;t notice the previous losses .
they add a blue to a green one , and they can make light .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
she said it would be like a thundering train of air .
am i looking like i just could write down a song ?
so when i put them next to each other , it wakes your interest .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so , for example , shake the environment , driving less car .
we can , of course , first look at the waste problem .
so the question is , how do we deal with these diapers ?
again , so in any store , you can get things back .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
but of course , it &apos;s the sum of a lot of ideas .
you can test it in your rooms after my talk .
it &apos;s a question of , can you get this to zero ?
has one in the audience ever seen anyone die of masses ?
please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
most of you are completely ignored by the memory of yourself .
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
when the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
just to precise times , you agree .
they &apos;re the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away from you .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform here .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges they have to face .
so today , evolution can happen in the time span of microseconds .
so now we &apos;ve removed the time scales .
i found that technology should make magic possible , not kill .
sometimes i lose weight , a story finally .
i want to end with a story that really excelled me .
because through marine protected areas , we &apos;re basically restoring the past .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-book .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful miner is the head of massey coal .
if we overdo it , we can shake a little bit back .
if you walk , yes , every footprint destroys the ground .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it much later .
most people usually start to orient themselves in terms of the task .
they evaporate their urine . they almost never do .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the living self .
this is going to influence politics , i think , in the coming years .
that &apos;s an amazing adventure you go to .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
think of this as a picture point , as a flying point .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
i was the only one who could talk to the aircraft companions .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego room .
almost like we &apos;re preparing our lives for it .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just work like that .
you have to make 62 different decisions to completely design your car .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
and what &apos;s below it is what we call bureaucracy .
we all need to believe in the end things we can &apos;t see .
innovation , creativity , development is not just coming out of our heads .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
we &apos;re left with cases like diginotar .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of diginotar .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation needs .
this is a whole book , an example of non-image data .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
economists call this a pareto improvement application .
we take pictures of these mini-big bangs in detectors .
i have to tell you , i think this was a big mistake .
then the same thing happens in a good , appropriate conversation .
because he doesn &apos;t know what haystack to go to first .
let &apos;s call it miguel . it &apos;s actually called miguel .
this is him highlighting a rare glitaway .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think so .
and as a general term , we can use the word &quot; intersexuality . &quot;
i mean , what does anybody do with so many outfits ?
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
i became the miracle of not dying that day .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
they , i think , don &apos;t even come from the museums .
car colors , outdoor color of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
he said , &quot; there &apos;s no death penalty in germany .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on that journey .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , of course , but what does that do ?
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful at it .
you feel that this is the real truth behind the emergence .
they have a five-tenths renewable energy rate today .
but as you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
and that &apos;s the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
that &apos;s scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
and if you do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
we produce androgen , and we respond to androgens .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty descending .
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
how did he get to look for help in this particular way ?
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
wr wants to help people who were convicted of innocent .
and i thought , this is going to be so hard , so painful .
this is technology innovation that &apos;s available today .
and the best part is probably what we expect in health .
but the question i want to leave is , why not ?
i want to help you with a very particular aspect of curiosity .
i &apos;m going to notice the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
now he &apos;s mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
usually you &apos;re just wrong , and some of them come , some of them don &apos;t .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it &apos;s supported .
they spend most of their time in assembling continually growing structures .
the first of these falls is a contradiction to admit complexity .
bonobos are with chimpanzees our closest living relatives .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the tempt room .
you go around the block and you take it as an epiphany .
i don &apos;t know how recipient people are going to be .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
this is evidence , by the way , that men are not pigs .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
ceos are a little bit above average . but this is where it gets interesting .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
well , i wondered , how can i really get this over ?
my inspiration comes from an event that lies back 2,500 years .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on the planet .
it &apos;s renewables , as they often call them .
this is a fish elevator in the southwestern corner of spain .
because i ask , how skillfully competent was this diagnosis ?
the written notes have the function of the letters of a script .
then these are fading influences of pre-industrial cultures .
that means you navigated over sound and over rhythm .
so this is just one use of many that you can do with it .
and then we worked out a code-of-the-field .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
six : social decline . seven : 65 deaths .
new investments to create well-paid jobs .
and they did it with what &apos;s called a lead-map .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
okay , let me squeeze a little bit of blood for you .
imagine that every single person is being run by us .
and guess what we found in the code of attacks ?
when you look at the people you have to do with ...
how about the contributions we can &apos;t even predict ?
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve had in the last half of the year .
but somehow , we can get rid of this problem .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
this hit me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to scientific achievement .
and these are just the biohackers now , the individual people .
so i &apos;ve been looking at what &apos;s natural or intuitive .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
i first ate it in a restaurant in southern spain .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
we hate too much government . we have no trust in the system .
we use games to get out of the real world &apos;s suffering .
we degrade a human being that has value for our society .
we tilted his bed so he can see outside .
here &apos;s a clip of this assault code .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
so maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview . &quot;
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
i like things that are weird . i like special things .
this airport alone has an area of 100 square kilometers .
turned the garbage clay on the page . went home .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
it was always so inspiring , so winding .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
56 percent of all rape cases are not in court .
well , in fact , the number of violent crimes has not changed very much .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
so , this looks like a basketball playoff .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
this actually only took two thousand really shapes , these networks .
i think that kind of sixth dollar or something like that .
so it &apos;s a very bored hack , i think .
this goes back to much more in the pre-industrial cultures .
and six milliseconds , also an exciting phenomenon .
no longer need to whistle or sing a song .
this is the time when an anecdote talks about , which you may know .
there was the core research facility called the leopoldshaven .
i asked him how he became such a fish expert .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-refreshing .
ah , the majority . i like to see that as a doctor .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
well , the living self lives its life continuously .
well , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness up .
our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for these bacteria .
but a lot of people are caught in a very strange position .
i brought seven underpants with me , and that &apos;s all .
but apart from that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange highway .
so it turns out it &apos;s very difficult to come up with all these extensions .
the biggest fear was that they were scared of pirates , rape and death .
pictures like this : a construction site along a much richer road .
somebody had broken in and hacked the system thoroughly .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the minerals .
it &apos;s also so clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they increase paralysis and reduce happiness .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
there came , i think , a very good code .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
and i &apos;m not sure they really stay here .
the composer becomes more and more to the friend you live with .
so here was finally a company that was trying to do it right .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re growing existential , not intense .
i grew up with a hearing portion of science fiction .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
this is actually the real melting of man and machine .
the secret is that the game is key to these skills .
this is what we call perceptual design in our lab .
well that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate now ? &quot;
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of constraints .
why is it important to reboot ? what is the red ?
an eighth , playful brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
finally , when we move forward , we should welcome the fear .
so a few years ago , i set out to do that .
possibilities that wouldn &apos;t have been allowed have been explicitly encouraged .
for example , the fish had been taken on a jellyfish trip .
so there are programs that can be the most numbers that can be done .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynch mobs .
how can a judge turn somebody into something they &apos;re not ?
what about a set of new ones , never before , ever heard .
basically , the concrete building block had become the building block of our time .
54 percent of the deaths were happening through drilling .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
should i answer that email ? should i write that letter ? &quot;
that means that the player certainly beat three out of 10 .
a long time ago , there were gray whales there -- 500 years ago .
many of you will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x unique interpretation of a piece is comparable to that .
from my point of view , i saw the janitor go up and down .
i always found very exciting in a glass of fireflies .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
so when i was 15 , i decided to become diver .
here i &apos;m expanding it a little bit . we &apos;re looking into the center right here .
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work , by the way , as a lawyer .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this and play with me .
you collect information about the piece in the secondary literature .
there are a lot of people working there now , and they can all engage .
but what if the image connects you to all your images ?
it &apos;s said that you never forget the names of those who die .
but it does something that no other government technology does .
because the categories tell me how to balance them .
so i sat down , and you played the tedtalk .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
and i tend to think of odds as my shadow .
studies were done in a way to see if that was true .
you can see already what there is tremendous speed possibilities there .
it comes from asia , naturally , in the case of japan .
because a good engineer either built cars or made nuclear power plants .
this was the very first beginning of a musical expression .
but when i ask her , how do you do that with your wife ?
you can only have nuclear missions if you &apos;re not there .
you &apos;re doing well . the question is , how are we going to do it ?
they rented your phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . they bought it .
official belief of all western industrialized societies .
&quot; do you remember the patients you sent home ? &quot;
we live on a planet that &apos;s 70 percent covered in water .
you know , just exchange the construction of apartments against cities .
that &apos;s to lie in a way that you can just misuse this logic .
often the music class is so that you learn to read the notes .
because these would be just the letters that you learned to paint .
tsunami warning . 9 : cyberattacks .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
we &apos;re developing to think together , cardiac beings .
and this is called the androgen receptor defect .
and i had to explain to the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
we find other oddities about what their rights are .
so all these green areas , these are the most targeted environments .
these people will be connected to the film in eternity forever -- forever .
this actually includes just a two-week period .
well , finally , the film took a very big snapshot .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
and it &apos;s spread unemployably , organic , of course .
and so i think the ted community should be bravers .
when someone lies , they &apos;re not just a liar .
i think in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
do you know what &apos;s called a 3,000 in major league baseball ?
and this is the message i took in medical school .
by the end of march , the lhc will be again operational .
this is our youngest beta-test on the bottom right there .
this is the period of most of the perceptions we have .
if we actually don &apos;t pick up phosphorus and give away .
and somehow we have to create changes that reduce that to zero .
people here contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination lead to success .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism in our culture .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
and so when we think about it , we have an interesting situation to do .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
i &apos;m sad that we never met each other as adults .
and just like this , all these companies disappeared one by one .
if you could do it for those , you could certainly help me .
but youtube is uploaded over 48 hours of video every minute .
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the most magical thing for me .
but nothing was invented that would let me go again so far .
and i was good , i graduated with cum laude .
and when i listened to her , she made keen noises .
we have distributed littlebits to kids , and you see them playing with them .
on september 10 , last year , the machine was on for the first time .
what were its circumstances , like society and politics ?
loud and purchase and f and so on .
man is supposed to come from the monkey or have a common ancestor .
i played the first sentence by beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
and this is something we need to learn , very quickly .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
and the question was , how could you connect technology to this ?
we want to use that as a possible pulse for the flyfire .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray notes and stuff like that .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called swing .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure continued .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
i love this one : &quot; watson forces human opponents . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely inconvenient .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding me , but i can live with that .
people said , &quot; well , are you not afraid to never succeed ? &quot;
here it says , the more you kill , the better .
so playing together allows playing games to grow in ties , trust and each other .
this is all reality today , and in the future , many more will be possible .
in my opinion , mass incarceration changed our world fundamentally .
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually do the experiments .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to make you very , very tired . &quot;
in the short time here , i realized one thing : ted has an identity .
i got in the car and was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so unfortunately , we have a little bit of removed from god .
just when it seems hardest , play is perhaps most necessary .
there &apos;s now all this crummy before the great unveiling .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , to be less bad .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d. student .
it &apos;s in the present right now , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetic engineering .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize in software for the winners .
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
there was no piano at all when bachs was an instrument .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
even if you were to shoot yourself now , you would have emissions .
most people know this from the software sector , most people know it .
this is actually live on the internet now . you can check it .
it &apos;s our new home country , called nunavut .
and the key indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
some of my noises happened in the last five years .
i looked into the rake , and it was a little pink .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular clay .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
that &apos;s why the dramatic high numbers come to prison inmates .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about the death penalty .
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .

and this is what happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite that experience .
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school assignments under the street .
it &apos;s become the largest and one of the most important private reserves in all of europe today .
and that &apos;s always an intuitive thing for us for humans to do if i have to think about it a little bit .
when something like this happened , people knew what this was . they called it his name .
in fact , we thought that was the end , but we tried to get the process a little bit further .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped her world view very much .
this didn &apos;t like my intuition , and maybe just because i don &apos;t play with particles that often .
i even come to one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
the real meaning of the word &quot; performance &quot; is where the word &quot; educe . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinarily good in whatever .
all of these photographs are connected , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
and then if you take good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
what &apos;s important is the creativity dominated in the internet culture of techie and geeks .
i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , the idea of perceiving and driving our environment .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies and was just designed for working with kids .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projector .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , this must be involved in movie art . &quot;
and if you have a hundred percent renewables , that &apos;s like a self-sustaining system .
but that &apos;s the same way that we &apos;re currently working on using the same approaches to develop vaccines .
and the salesman said , &quot; do you want snake , slightly obvious or wide ?
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm &apos;s supercomputer watson at the risk ?
one of the most important things is that we have to remember that government is not the same as politics .
we &apos;re going to push , for example , the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna in common with chimpanzees .
that could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; she &apos;s packing it in the eggs . &quot;
we work with universities all over sub-saharan africa , and we invite them to learn how to redesign social .
so many people in the world right now , who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
this creates a very strong picture in your head . this is much stronger than a white pill .
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to reach , and then we talk about the intermediate step .
and the reality of that expression reaches us all , and moves , inspired and united .
we &apos;ve developed , for example , an ice cream package , which is at room temperature , liquid .
unfortunately , they &apos;re not in openbach , but maybe they can help the frankers a little bit .
in high school , one of the students once said that brian goldmann would learn for a blood test .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard before .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and like a lot of people , i thought the government was all about choosing people in an office .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that limited us is our imagination .
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would you be like ?
so i &apos;m basically talking about , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
because the lesson i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
and maybe we only know what wood we &apos;re from when we &apos;re really being tested .
a third sentence that immediately appears in people who have a strong sense of soul .
this is what &apos;s called the shape law , or the shape psychology , which also affects us in perception .
that &apos;s a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to actual existence as a creator .
all of this needs the ability , our basic ability , to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
and so the interest in this technology , this is where i came in a little bit .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by going down one way or another .
this question was so poignant that we decided to explore the answer and evolved sift .
we say , &quot; computers , please generate a hundred million randomly selected sequences of instructions .
make ways that are easy to use and start with this , hug patients on the team .
and i think the most important point about this is that we stopped talking to our patients .
so we might sell a shoe , and it will be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever worn ...
why not have the fast muscle fibers that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
we know that as human beings , we work optimally when we do hard , meaningful work .
we know from this study that you have to reach out to the needle when it comes to the point .
i brought you an example of the nootka indian tribe .
maybe to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creativity .
we have now almost an infinite selection of phones , especially in the mobile world .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can anticipate the evolution .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , of ease , of justice .
so we could end the world very easily with a dumb , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
the idea here , obviously , is not just to overlist the machine operators in the control room .
here &apos;s something really cool that we discovered -- blew me out of the socks .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
now , when i was a mere in college , i had my first biology class .
and that &apos;s half the world &apos;s wastewater problems caused by the textile industry .
this is almost too limited to complete security -- possibly for fish , definitely for us .
in this country , for children , there are lifelong sentences without conditional punishment .
here &apos;s what we need under policing correctness to bring over and over again .
we need to prevent people from knowing things , especially when they &apos;re true .
that i &apos;m just doing this differently and more beautiful doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better handable .
now all the rest of the world are reproductions that have best sorted numbers .
his mother was locked in as a punishment for -- to be wealthy for the crime .
she somehow managed to find the time to acquire english and it-qualifications .
famine in somalia . anchor 3 : police &apos; spray .
because obviously , an animal that was very common becomes rare first before it dies .
but what makes voodoo so interesting is this vivid relationship between the living and the dead .
something as profound as our identity is now a matter of choice as to show this slide .
it actually took a few years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
in china , a post-doc is still called honey pots today , so to speak , right ?
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s phosphorus .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are master players .
players love to become part of the awe of missions of planetary prices .
and the argument here is that the wheels of evolution are starting to grind , but they &apos;re desperate .
i was the second volunteer at the brand , so i had some pretty good opportunities to be able to go in .
and the next kidneys make androgens , which are viriering hormones .
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more fresh .
i felt like we were having our fancy clocks and cameras dream of it .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send her home , and there was no man in her treatment either .
by shaking the sift and putting it next to each other , he can let the characters interact ...
you can &apos;t emphasize how important this factor can be for the quality of life of a human being .
either &quot; flhyfusion &quot; or &quot; paradise winds , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
to become part of the constitution , but it has to be approved twice by congress .
as a child , i had collections of sticks , rocks , tiles and shells .
part of these archaic models is that we have a virtually natural relationship with virtuality .
and in reality , when we fail , when we hit obstacles , we often feel different .
for her , life had asked her a problem : her family escape and a new life in australia .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska methane , methane is challenged by itself from water .
so , in the kind of shift of evidence , you see the magnificence of the lie .
and this is how you see animals right next to 500 degrees celsius that they can survive there .
so in order for us to understand each other , i want to show you a very basic , simple magic trick .
michael j. nelson of the mystery science theater was one of the first to make a joke on twitter about this .
also , despite their logarithmic process on the left , it &apos;s going up .
the other day they got to go -- woman , a woman , a mother and a grandmother .
both are strong understatements because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
so probably or evil aquulture , fisheries , will be part of our future .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
this sounds very spacey and sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physically the european .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most common children &apos;s book author .
and sometimes when something about ted comes , it gets a meaning and a force that it doesn &apos;t otherwise have .
you have to make the sound of the wind , blow it away and read the rest of the book .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we &apos;re all fighting for , for who to talk ; they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
you might think that this is just a landscape picture , and the bottom part has been manipulated .
and the next piece is four women in three generations building together a new life .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
just to give you the overview , i &apos;ll zoom out to see what you get .
and as part of that , they gave us a concept that was about anatomical commonalities .
or are we going to be different -- something that might be adapted to the environment better ?
i really hope that we play meaningful games together to survive another century on this planet .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and soulful to ourselves , who can afford it .
we got to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
and the preparation for that was enormous . we had to build cameras and headlights and all kinds of things .
and what we can now read in the daily newspaper almost every day , find that in that third sentence .
one example from a very different area . monet painted the seerosis x times .
and i want to ask you to go to protocol that i was here for my part of the job today .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the phi x 174 genome .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique sound of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this information is presented .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than now that less is more .
i thought , &quot; make the camera out of &quot; would mean we wanted to have a backup conversation .
so for example , number 164 , it &apos;s very sticking out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
when these dots fall down , you can write on them , you can display patterns , images , text .
our cities have been equipped , over the last few years , with networks and electronics .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not made up of teeth and claws alone .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotted stuff , like manifestations .
i believe that somehow you &apos;ve moved to nostalgia to wonder .
if you put an executive administrator on the team , they get significantly better .
bill gross has several companies , among other things , one called esolar has great solar thermal technologies .
one , the energy density that these technologies are generating is dramatically lower than the power plants .
that means that 15 pounds of wildfish are needed to get a pound of sugar .
we just wanted to know what happened to a normal electrochemical battery .
a television or a washing machine , they just use it , they don &apos;t use it .
in a sense , the arctic ice caps is the beating heart of our global climate system .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows something .
and this was an example in which our own governments are using the technology against us , the citizens .
we want to fight prebition and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually took .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
and what we actually did , we , humanity , is we started to abstract .
this is because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the top 15-inch .
at the end of one day , i cooked a giant pot soup that we shared .
the next piece of puzzle is how a boat is running in the early morning red in the lake .
one of the ways that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using a lot of the time , is evolution itself .
we had a team of fellows last year in boston in order to program the code for america .
so , imagine that you &apos;re in several places at the same time , how would that feel ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
so the neurons are the information processing system that these cell communities have built .
so , we were able to connect the little digital warhead to the rotor tax .
echinacea , a little antioxidanism that helps you jump .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about has to do with the fact that you deceive of yourself .
when professors get curious , they &apos;re often shrugged into this n research semester .
what &apos;s happened is the machine age , and it &apos;s happened is the book , and it &apos;s the photolitography .
and it &apos;s about solving a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with the fourth generation fuels , and that &apos;s about 18 months from now .
it turns out it meant , in fact , &quot; we don &apos;t want to have anything to do with your film . &quot;
the moment a film director had demanded a stage change .
that &apos;s like , if i said , shoot your child , it only blew three times instead of five times .
i talked to the oil industry recently , and they said they understood this model exactly .
and the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
but there are no clues that we can look around where you learn how to do fire .
his cause of writing the piece becomes more and more to my personal cause of playing it .
but these concepts of the cyberage , they bring us back these opportunities to rediscover our ability .
so these tends to survive longer , and they multiplied at a larger scale .
so it just creates the words that we use over and over again in the language of politically correct speech .
the first example assumes what many of you know and some of you estimate , very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
you can see it &apos;s a kind of pillar , often called a &quot; traveling wave reactor . &quot;
and that &apos;s because these fanatics , who were nuts , were not fanatics at all .
nothing moves into my sleeve or comes out , not trickiness , and you can study everything .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is just the opposite .
this is also the entertainment value of this talk , so i hope you enjoy it .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your body ?
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , that &apos;s more successful , that &apos;s more friendly ?
it &apos;s almost physiologically impossible to be bad at wearing light red pants .
now , morgan , on behalf of transparency , this : what happened to the $ 7100 ?
and also , a study recently was done with ceos , where they watched the ceos for a week .
we developed an app for layar , extended reality , to find these aeds .
because in this context , we &apos;re only beginning to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years .
and this really captures these ideas to create these constraints to the place that &apos;s available on the screen .
we &apos;ve managed to get up to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that &apos;s here .
so we had to develop a new method where we could put together these little pieces and get the errors corrected .
so for the learning process of music , at least as long as it is for spoken language .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got to face two years later when we moved to california .
i mean , any of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing their lifestyle .
unfortunately , this is all good news , because there are a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned a lot .
so we have the memory itself and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know ourselves ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
i got another gift , which is to look into the future and come back and live differently .
so we also overlist our brains , because our brains just don &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
i adored my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to court and do this crazy case .
if i put myself in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when you break the goldfish glass , so that everything is possible , you lower happiness .
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
this is a game with words that &apos;s a kind of scrabble and boggle .
because a lot of times people come , they can &apos;t do it in a way that &apos;s user-friendly so that anyone can deal with it .
first of all , sounds very banal , but it &apos;s so exciting that if you get closer to that .
oversight : now i &apos;m kind of interacting with the object , can zoom out again , zoom in .
here we see the one again here , the one again , the whole aggregate , again .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor guy who seems a little bit difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design shop .
people wrap up in their faith , so tightly that you can &apos;t free them .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
i found the time i spent in that hospital , just great -- except for my physiotherapy .
evolution is all about the passing of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
well , you know , on all cases , no one has to be a reckless candidate .
if you surround yourself with the right people , not only will you understand it , but you will appreciate it .
so doing things like this -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
they push the decision -- push it down , even if it comes to their own best interest .
so in other words , the future has shrunk by a year since i was in the world .
and we install an evolutionary process in this machine that &apos;s going on in the microsecond area .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them go into the next century .
the greeks called these divine diy minds of creativity &apos;s demons .
here we see a very basic service . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
there are diseases in the rich world that millions of us have threatened only one generation ago , barely yet .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon children will die again , because that &apos;s just a matter of numbers .
because if we could figure that out , we would have sort of unprecedented human potential before .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure , and you say , &quot; we &apos;re running out of oil . &quot;
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then increase my strength and persistence .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re only different from a few nucleotides ?
who knows when the film comes out , we might look like a horror vollidiot .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , that the wirelesslan works .
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer that immediately , but this is what &apos;s going to happen , and this is going to happen right now .
i certainly would never reach an alien world with a spaceship , and it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
that would have been without the environmental challenge , but it makes it so much more important .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the successes of the scientific method .
they played a cube game , and the winners were allowed to break down to an epic adventure .
the founding fathers , from my point of view , were the original anatomical activists , and that &apos;s why .
and to win , the device has to do better diagnosis than a team of highly skilled doctors .
it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- 75 stones for every person on the planet .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the blow storm .
we hope that no longer does pop ups and other nonsense mean -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
he has no piece of paper , he has no pen , he has no cassette records .
as peter told us , not only did they produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two species of self , you &apos;ll end up doing very different things .
i &apos;m probably going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
we use this great euphemism , try and error that turns out to be meaningless .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a , or we could do b .
immediately , they &apos;re going to experience one that , of course , makes such a prediction , you can &apos;t prove that .
the human part of this book , way to the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
my heart raced , i was dizzy , trying to write what was in front of me .
but once in a while , very rarely , something special happened , and one of the performers actually became transcendent .
for example , in openness , 20 percent of the garbage is now wind garbage .
but here &apos;s the thing : if you have evidence , you have to adopt this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite , harvester workers at pieter breugel in the met .
i want to explain to you about this mechanism today or get something that you &apos;re unlikely to be familiar with .
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitoes , and somehow people liked that .
they care about the designers , they usually have it in the first semester , the great shape-shifting laws .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that fresh water .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
the viral particles were then released by the cells and came back and killed e. coli .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve missed that point long at which choice improves our public good .
when i went back to that 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half its size .
most of the mass incarceration in this country has not really happened in the class of violent crimes .
this is a talk that &apos;s going to suggest that investing money in more security forces and security .
police officers came in and represented state lawyers and office workers .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
so for me , photography seemed to be more about going in the right place at the right time .
and this sadness really evolved in one thought , which is that i just wish one thing to do .
and by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years since his , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
you don &apos;t sit around twisting . there &apos;s always something important to do .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we can keep from our experiences is a story .
do you say there are negative impacts that have to do with the clouds that move things around ?
this is kind of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we need to stop .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
i was told they &apos;re not biting . in fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
that &apos;s why a lot of people also come and look at it , because you can see what problems you get .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of man .
well , just to end , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about fathers a lot .
there are things as controversial as these whole genetically engineered plants on the apples .
so , as citizens , you &apos;re going to be able to deal with these scientific technologies .
because the bottom is going to die off the mosses , and the wind and the water is going to wash away the ground .
they lie , they cheat , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they produce really droughts .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted the person is when they think about their lives .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of development in a non-profit organization called robin hood .
so the idea is that we actually include the people in which they &apos;re doing things together , collectively .
well , an epiphany is usually something you find because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere .
so , by and large , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;ve actually determined what the goal is .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all of these images you can make your own collection .
the result is that no matter where i &apos;m from , i &apos;m treated as if i &apos;m denied at the bottom .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really have to go back into cycles .
and yes , the discussion is all about the question of how far can you take a piece of the far future ?
i met mr ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall .
if anyone had built a two-inch construction , they would have worn the price home .
they &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war ever made .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
but not only that -- merging and connecting with the universe and other devices out there .
i spent a lot of my time in life trying to be myself and adapt at the same time .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , as you know from documentaries .
the rotor is this moving part inside the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
yet my interest in photography began when i received my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press it down .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process begins when the trigger is squeezed .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow to make a realistic result .
and every time it divided , the chemicals in it have spread to countless quantities .
i think it &apos;s also important for me to create something that &apos;s indian , but it &apos;s also very timely .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community bring us ?
for these non-engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics just became another material .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taken in by the mind . how can you do damage ?
so people who think of evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time have missed a lot of biology .
there &apos;s an old african saying : &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
of course , in holland , you understand this easier because in holland , of course , the country is built on flowers .
this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single wikipediaseite .
if we can do that , this current data trap will make sense of a new source of information .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
if you have 10 teams that typically do happen , you get about six who have stable structures .
the challenge is to have a shared experience , a common language , or basic , to build the right prototype .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the sense of oddness , a sense of imity , is a sense of our own power .
when a spirit has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new form of existence .
and you &apos;re going to offer them all the nutrients they only want without effort on them .
and it seemed something to have to do with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
i &apos;ve tried to make it clear how valuable cities are to how much more valuable they are than what they cost .
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , grandmother . i promise . &quot;
they live in a world that has information and communication in its abundance , as nobody could have predicted .
they found an article with false thought , they could detect the creator of this thought .
we made little pieces , we made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing in a moment .
when i come , with my little v piesel and i &apos;m wrong , that feeling comes up .
that was the reason . it was the justification . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
and i noticed how much these deep sea gears resembled a space mission .
there are very , very few things you can even say , of which there is a chance in a million .
and , although it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard , because it urges people to work very quickly .
so the performance of working with prototypes is a lot -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccinations for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
i know we can do it , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , this is something the world needs now .
but danny , the whole american aspiration is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
our language is behind the social change that has been triggered in many cases by a technological change .
so we actually designed a few little markers in this project to track the garbage as it goes through the system .
icebergs are born as a calf of a glacier , or by breaking out of ice sheets .

and from my point of view , the scientific method of trying things out is to see if it works , changing it if it doesn &apos;t , is it one of the greatest achievements in humanity ?
a lot of arguments about it . fishing plants contaminate the environment , most of you anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . it &apos;s a big disadvantage .
and because they work much harder physically than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they correspond to their weight , in energy use , something 30 billion people .

the second trap is a change in experience and memory : it &apos;s basically between being happy in his life and being happy about his life or happy with his life .
you go up into that capsule , you float down into this dark , hostile environment where there &apos;s no hope for rescue if you don &apos;t recreate it yourself .

and yet , burning coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkably clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
what do you think of as the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedic , a birthday shelter , should be a rescue assistant ?
if you play , you &apos;ll see some nuances here that are zoomed up , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows are a surprise .
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classic softer , you need five hours and this new kind of natural software just an hour .
i &apos;m a wall animal . to work , i have to get up and sweat at at the same time every day , struggle and intersect really uncomfortable .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the cube game and agreed a national strategy , and in one day you would eat food . the next day you would play .
the other note is whether we use zero emissions in technology , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed world , and we &apos;re on our way to get it to the rest .
i sold this as a movie studio , &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . &quot; it became a love movie , a passionate movie .
so far in discussions , these insulans , they make self-sustaining , they have their own little net , which has to do with our connected and nothing to it .

and what happens is that when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in the climate .
they stare at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is flood channels and this dense , lush march .
we now have , from our discoveries all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me tremendous confidence in our future , is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to face the huge challenges of our planet .
so an app written in a few days , and then spread from rare , is a kind of shot before the bug , to the institution of the government .

a colleague of mine had access to investment acts from vanguard , the giant fondal society of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and so , my primate comrades , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together while we rediscover the creativity of cameroon and wonder .
so the people who decided to participate tend to be more likely to have more choices available to them , the more they avoided to choose stock and finds .
that means pay attention , if you know this , watch who you look at for a long time , because i don &apos;t take a gun for what &apos;s going to happen .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where , during the pursuit , the surveillance system is fed with pre-recorded video recording .
now of course , crazy in the context of my talk , we &apos;re moving physically into non-existing virtual worlds , looking for the holodeck .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve spent the last few years trying to do at the institute of the future ?
we can watch our kids play football in the football , and we have our cell phone on the one hip , and our blackberry on another hip , and our laptop is probably on our lap .
just the things that run away , like shoe skins , like brakes , like cars , that need to be so that they go to biological systems .
do i get you right ? your software is enabling that within a certain time , within the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world are basically connected ?
i have the impression that when we do vacation , it &apos;s very often the case , which means we tend to make vacation in the service of memory itself .

so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different research places -- that you can just apply in your business .
so if we keep thinking about these things , the obvious response to people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter to me because i &apos;m a good citizen .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , i left the hospital , and i went to the parking lot to drive home with the car when i did something i didn &apos;t do otherwise .

in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is just briefly measured ; the animal kingdom , like a single stroke ; and human life , a little notebook .
while they realized how to reach out and intervene , pick up the blades and move them , they actually learned how to think and how to solve problems through understanding and changing space contexts .

to understand that , that means building deep into the ground , almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel , that used uranium , and then the process starts working down and continued to work down ?
and of course , by the byproduct of all of this , the immense virtual models of every interesting part of the world , which has not only been preserved by overflipping or satellite images and so on , but by collective storage .
i did some research , talked to some people at the met , and in fact , it &apos;s a game called squail , where one gans is beaten with a stick on tuesday .

otherwise , i ask you , when i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is , are you ready to hear about the decision-overload problem ?
the consequence is that somebody like me actually had a brain that was exposed to more androgens than a woman born with testicles and had a androgen receptor defect .
i &apos;m sitting here , and basically giving sound to me , gruesome , hoping to create a rather confused idea in your head that has a certain similarity to my original idea .
but here was a world i could actually enter here on earth , and it was as fascinating and exotic as all the things i had imagined when i read these books .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that rivers now tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , waste of pest fatalities .
after what logic of this deception , this self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the one we actually know in the unconscious way that it &apos;s valid to spread outside .
if you can imagine making these 20 million different genes , or optimizing these processes to make octanium or drugs new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology with just a small team than the last 20 years of science .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this .

each of these techniques i &apos;m going to tell you today is thinking to help them manage the opportunities -- well , they can use it for themselves , well for the people they provide service .
that means there could be something on average , which is feminine brains from male brains , which makes us more aware of highly complex social relationships , and more aware of the protective needs .
i &apos;m going to make my images of these icebergs as if i were to make portraits of my ancestors , consciousness , that they exist in these individual moments of this way , and never will exist again .

i live professionally from building computers , and i know that i couldn &apos;t use the mechanism that i use to build computers without the recent advances in computer technology .
now we can do it more closely , and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to extend their lives .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so of course , i &apos;m also looking at the subject of curiosity , and how does the curiosity change our thinking again , and why do we maybe lose curiosity and repel and so on and so forth ?

now if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government officials , some of them come from science . some , even less , come from business . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the music .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been looking at it for a few years now with biohacking , and i started doing it because i just wanted to know it more specifically , and i wanted to do it myself , which i learned theoretically .
and i left medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , i was as close to complete as possible that i was immune to making errors .
and then if i go one step further into these natural user interfaces , where i , by voice , by touch , by gesture , by gesture , by mouse and cursor , i &apos;m even faster , and more immediate .

coal evolution pushed the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , climate conditioners , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
we turned the light off , put it in a vacuum , suck out all the air , cooling it up until almost now , all the way down on the elevator , the piece of metal was free to behave as it wanted .
but because this didn &apos;t happen here , we can displace it , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and preach messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live .

and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a new one , in the picture -- and not just okay , but something that you have to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boat .
and so i get a very different view from the city , a very different idea , which is that i see negative and positive zones in a city , and i get a very different virtual map of a very real city .

maybe they actually saved their people through games by whispering into games for 18 years and then having them come into games and learn so much about playing with each other that they saved all of the civilization .
they left lydics and went looking for a new home , just leaving behind as many people as there were food to survive and looking for the rest for an area where they could thrive .
they threw shiny photos of themselves out of the air , which we would as a friendly gesture , forgot that these people from the rainforest in their lives had never seen anything two-dimensional .

this is a problem because warming is looking at the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there are large amounts of frozen carbon that , if it &apos;s looking up , is transferred from microbes to methane .
what we also found out is that the goal of the attack was actually to have it happen slowly and enormously -- obviously trying to make warning engineers desperate so they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind it fast .

it &apos;s in it -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made up of normal letters that we use to symbolize -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna and i &apos;ve amplified it 10 mexico 22 times .
and i wonder today how much his vision of myself as a strong and powerful and powerful girl formed my self-image , and i could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethal people .
and there you &apos;re called from my general doctor , so that he can see where my weight problem is , not only the moment i need cardiological support or something , but also the view of the past .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early &apos; 80s when i was just starting elementary school , and started building and forming my self-image outside my family environment , even in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
it &apos;s a picture of the first radiation particle that returned all the way around the lhc , then deliberately collided with some of the lhc to allow a rain of particles to bounce into the detector .
he killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red beds , bone blouts and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know can slow down the course of aids .
and finally , i think even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , we &apos;re not measured at the end of our technology , not the things we &apos;re developing , not the intellect and minds .
and because i was born without a waving legs , and my feet had been disgusted after them , and i had just a few toes on this , and a few toes on the other foot , he was the overwhelm , that stranger had to deliver the bad news .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that over 20 years ago , when i first told them i was a teenager that i wanted to be a writer , i was confronted with the same kind of anxious response .
when we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us are transformed into our best version at any given time and instant , trying to solve the problem intractable as long as it takes to try it after the failure again .
and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices up , because things are supposed to get more intuitive , more natural , more user-friendly , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually natural for us humans , what &apos;s user-friendly or intuitive .
are you afraid that you &apos;re going to go through this craft and never create anything out of it and you &apos;re going to die on a junkyard of dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter of the failure ?
and when i sit there for another halboval , suddenly we see not just one unit , which is circle , circle , and yet we see one unit , we don &apos;t see more three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
they took these photographs off the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , found nothing , and concluded that this was business cards of the devil , and they killed the five missionaries with the spear .
i was always attacking my synonymous dictionary in writing , but i was already done with the work of texting , and i noticed that i &apos;d never beaten up in my life what the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
imagination is more skill , and with that phrase , i &apos;d like to end with a and again reference , designers need to think differently to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention and request .
and i definitely know that for me , in my situation , it would be very dangerous to start , to kind of download this dark path of conjecture -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the target from the eyes . don &apos;t give up . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand on the edge of an epic victory that we prefer to spend all of our time in these worlds .
later on the day , i went around on this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
last year i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps , which for nearly three million years , had shrunk the size of the bottom 48 states by 40 percent .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles to philadelphia to baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black men are either in prison , abandoning currency , or with conditional criminal justice .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that this high-technology you see is going to bring you into the future , but in fact , the future is right with us , in our archaic roots .
immediately after this election , between the 21st and february 24th , a delegation of about 30 famines went to the two places in the world that were most interested in entering the city &apos;s business .
the last example i have time to show today is a music sequencer for live records that we &apos;ve recently developed and act in the sift as sound , like leadership , bass and drums .
and we started creating pieces , starting with pieces of five to seven letters , assembling them together to make 24,000-letter pieces to put them back together , up to 72,000 letters .
so i started thinking , and i think with certainly in the past few months , working on the book that &apos;s going to seem soon -- as the dangerous , scary , well-expected successor of my passing success .
both in my career at robin hood and my side job as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m witnessing generosity and kindness at the big scale , but i also see actions in the next love and the mud of individuals .
if you think about life in a particular remote area , and you have a beloved person with constigious heart disease vessels , and your doctor outlines it to a cardiologist whose average performance is in vascular performance in 200 .
but when i had a telephone with him , and i asked him why he did these interventions -- it was high risky surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would be treated very badly , and so he had to do it .
and of course , when is a little bit intuitive , and how can i influence it as a creator and make things like this so that they &apos;re a user-friendly , so they &apos;re intuitive because then they &apos;re fun and easy to use .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who make them -- those who constrain the sleep deprivation and those who constrain them with bad results and good results .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in high-regulated countries , is high . the question of security is that you can really feel that nothing can go wrong despite human participation , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do its work because we &apos;re afraid we &apos;re a real dead end , and it holds millions of people flourishing .
now , buying a glass of mars is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the decision-making overload problem also affects us in very consequence decisions .
i don &apos;t have to arrange these things emotionally , because right around the corner , there &apos;s always going to be another crazy , colorful , radiation outfit that &apos;s waiting for me to love if i have a little love in the heart and search for it .
so that &apos;s the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less satisfaction with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
here &apos;s a photograph i took in the northern end of the baffin islands when i went to narwhal hunt with inuits , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
they enabled us to tell the story of neuromarketing , the way we tell the story in this movie , that today you use mris to map the pleasure centers of the brain , both to make advertising and movies .
i had to change individual exercises seemingly infinitely with these thick , elastic bands -- in different colors -- you know this to build my leg muscles , and i hated these bands more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a bacterial chromosome . it had over 580,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we &apos;d build it in cassette tapes from the size of the virus that we could vary the size of the cassette tapes to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
and from a conversation this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators at do it yourself , i want to share with you -- he gave me permission -- his technology called the slingshot , which many of you may have heard of . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator in the student &apos;s home .
cloud computing , something my friends at autodesk call infinite computing , sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that allow personal production to democratize our planet , synthetic biology , fuels , vaccines and food , digital medicine , nano-materials and artificial intelligence .
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo akolyths in a trceful state , acquiring the glowing coal without combustion , an amazing illustration of the ability of the mind to influence the body to hold it in a state of extreme arousal .
this was the most surreal form of a d√©jlike vu i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i ever got around a corner of bog , i always knew what would appear in the light cone of the vehicle , because i walked through the movie set for months when we made the film .
in this picture , i &apos;ve set a bush as a center of despair in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing specialities on the top of these branches have succeeded in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it has demonstrated its environment fitness and strength .
and s o with this premise then , for example , brian degger in england tried to put together a minimum abor , then took a steam cone , a heat plate , and , yes , soup breeding , and then bacteria have grown .
and then came from the do-it-yourself bio org website from founders , and said o.k , we really need to meet now , also make real meetings , and then organized two events , one in london , two thousand , and shortly after that in the u.s. , in san francisco .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of services every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service and co2 that &apos;s emitted per unit of energy .
and the realization of president lobo was that the confidence of the implementation i &apos;ve thought of as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build this city could be equivalent to all the parties in honduras that have been under fear and mistrust for many years .
i read this list to a friend loud , and i first had to laugh , it worked so ridiculous , but i just came up to &quot; train , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t talk to them anymore , and i had to stop reading and collect myself after this random word tide and the connected emotional shock .
a group of ankara i met a while ago , they have a group of students who like to communicate more what they learned in college , and they have done so on street little actions and tried to explain to people what that that is .
and this was really , really bitter , and you get in such a period , and it showed up to a picture where i wondered , after 10 years , there was a thousand mark , which was , you know , basic wage , you know , in the collective of course , whether it should be really the great thing to do .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;ve given to microsoft as part of a year ago , which is seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either avoid local or removed with huge amounts of visual data .
there are 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different extra olive oil and you have 12 balsamico that you could buy to make a large number of your own salad of dessings , in the improbable case that none of the 175 in the store is right for you .
the first thing is , when you grow up as a child , as a baby , you take care of what the message you have is , right ? and the more you have , the more or less in your parents have allowed you to play and to move , the more , the more in your curiosity , of course , is woven .
i mean , most of the moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve calculated this -- you know , the psychological present is true of about three seconds , which means , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a month . in a month , there are about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any trace .
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the big scientists what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million . and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it works reasonably , you &apos;re only in the 100 million .
this really works , this is done in the academic mind , and we thought , okay . so maybe we &apos;ll get this too , then we took a webcam that would screw down the lens , turn off the lens , you &apos;ve got a microscope that &apos;s zooming in about four hundred times .
if i show you 600 magazines and i split them into 10 categories , or i show you 400 magazines , and i split them into 20 categories , you think i &apos;ve given you more choice and better choice than i would have given you the 400 , versus if i gave you the 600 .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody &apos;s license to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday . ttin &apos;down on friday . you wouldn &apos;t have thought we were going to have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
i think a significant one -- not the only one , but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the disappointment because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences , they think it would be their fault .
the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment the cult of the seed , replaced the poetry of the shaman through the prose of the priesthood and hierarchy , specialization and overload -- only 10,000 years ago .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , on one in the room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid and then move them into this focus , so , this is captured there , basically , like a tractor beam .
it would be great if we could share this paradigm of normal thought against another set of possibilities or strength to make it a little bit more dangerous , exchange it a little bit more . so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their special and valuable skills to society .
you know , michelangelo shaped moses , meaning he took the end of the hammer and threw it to moses -- in fact , you can still see a little spot on the outside -- and said , &quot; perch√© non parli ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
but if you buy a new color printer today in 2011 from the leading laser printing factories and print a page , this page of bright yellow spots on every side , in a pattern that clearly leaves the page back to you and their printer .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could tell you a lot more about what &apos;s going on and the many other wonderful things you can perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk about the second part that we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s the emphasis of our environment .
well , the problem with this -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the difficult situation of innate , look at them as orginian and colorful , but they somehow reduced to the past , while the real world , our world .
i then tried to expand this at my lab at home a little bit , and then bought myself the power handle on ebay and did some d.n.a analysis , tried to do a fatherest , so anyway , like that d.n.a fingerprinting , back home .
and if you picked another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about time , in terms of memories , you might get a different answer .
he spoke in a very hot and social note about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers would never get into baseball world series , and all of this because of the first violin in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
whenever we think about innate and landscape , we either call it rousseau and the old framework of the noble wild , which is , in its simplification , a racial thought or , on the other hand , thoreau and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the convenience of the life of an unknown suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who graduated every day as they had for 20 years , telling each other &apos;s stories and singing them , three of them still are in the same bed .
but we don &apos;t even listen to somebody like this because we &apos;ve known this kind of statement for so long . somehow we &apos;ve accepted the notion that creativity and collectively , that somehow creativity and suffering and that art , at the end , leads to the seel-qual all the time .
and what we did was we actually used a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone network -- and use anonymous and aggregated information from this network that was being collected anyway from the operators to understand how the city works .
and then the renaissance came along , and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was , let &apos;s put the human individual at the center of the universe -- all the gods and mysteries . and there &apos;s no room for mystical creatures to accept the commands of divinity .
in our desire to protect the people that we care about and tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical projections , or even to put a forecast on the quality of life that they expect , we have to pay attention that we &apos;re not going to put the baseline for somebody to actually be disabled .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that alleviate the problem of policy-overlapping -- narrow -- they get rid of the superfluous alternatives ; concrete -- make it real ; categorize -- we can do better with more categories , less possibilities ; prepared for complexity .
because we have this self-deception , this feeling of being great , this ancestry of the highest beings , not of such a natural deception , of something as unpredictable as an organism that still exists , comparable to a stone , and whatever else , that &apos;s unstoppable to us .
this seems a little bit wakeful first , so i repeat it to make it work : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try to play online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
and our goal was , we wanted to get up to 70 to nine percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable with it , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you do it from batteries .
but they found 17 brand partners who were willing to get rid of that control that wanted to do business with someone as eight and as i playful as i was , and that eventually empowered us to tell stories that we couldn &apos;t normally tell -- stories that would never support an advertiser .
but in fact , they &apos;d been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never reason to simulate whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes ! with the right kind of materialistic approach , it looks like it &apos;s going to work .
but the process and the heavy climb that surrounds it was picked up when he took the genius out of it , where he got nothing more than trouble and left him where he came from , and he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an internalized , tormented thing .
this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called pass eat , pray , love cells -- that , unlike all my previous books , for some reason , went out into the world and became a big mega-event , international best seller thing .
and that &apos;s when you forget all your feelings about politics and the snake at the work office and all the other things we &apos;re really excited about is government , at the core , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; what we do in common , that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
a continent is always left out , because the guess was that there were no religious faith in sub-saharan africa . of course , there was one , and voodoo is just the remaining of this very profound religious thought that came along during the tragic diaspora of slavery .
but in fact , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to be limited , and the unimportant similarities are going to be rid of , well , there &apos;s a increase in sales , there &apos;s a cost of it , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement in decision-making .
and one day he saw me in one of my exercises -- these exercises were just tired and worrying -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear one day down one of these benches .
and wind and sun simulated , and the load came to the conclusion , a very exciting conclusion that you could get to the conventional system , which takes a middle strain of about 50 cents a kilowatt-hour after 20 years , about 40 cents a kilowatt-hour .
and problem , not only is it a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can be a problem , it can be a problem with access , which is simple , so any problem , to throw up a question , and how can you do it differently , or how can you do it better ?
feeding grain of herbivores , pests of monocultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken from fish , and all the time the agribusiness just asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? &quot;
not through the latest powers and tractor inventions , but through fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through chainsaw , but through forests , not through fishing boats and nets , but through fish .
this is a more artistic facility , so there are a lot of artists and philosophers and scientists working with trying to deal with these technologies and to process them creatively , there are museum exhibitions and yes , all kinds of things .
the leaders of the government in honduras would be dependent on the help of partnerships , and they could benefit from their partner countries , which they would help create the laws for this charter and for leadership , that everybody can trust charter .
now , not exactly what i hoped for , but i went up -- the stairs , the hallway , past the &quot; real &quot; firemen who were already pretty finished by the deletion room to get a pair of shoes .
with total transparency , what new thinking is , what bangs on old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the lasagne horse meat and no beef is anymore or other phenomena , i want to just swap that up and do that at all .
in my about 20 years of medical awareness and journalism , i created a personal medical study on medical errors and false treatments to learn everything i could for one of my first articles i wrote for the toronto star of my show , white coat , black art .
and where you can see how far we are from what we really wanted to get to and could be , and how sad we are that we are on earth at all , you can see that , for example , openbach has a program , until 20 , you want to be here with climaneul , right ?
they may do a modern contribution , and if they did better than i expect , that would be great , but my core statement here is that we have to work on all those five of them , and we can &apos;t give them up because they shine us , because they all have significant problems .
in others , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house , and the poem rolled through her , and she missed . she said it would continue to move across the country , and , as she said , by looking for another poet , she said .
up-attributes are things that are playful , fresh like the fresh prince , timely , adventurous , failing and loving like erol flynn , agile and agile , professional , magical and mystic like gandalf .
they add the out-of-the-box co2 that leads to temperature increases , and that temperature increases has some very negative consequences , effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the indirect consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to such rapid changes , and therefore whole systems collapse .
she ran like the devil to the house while she was pursued by this poem , and it was all about having to get to a piece of paper and a pencil so that if it was donated through them , she could catch and hold on the leaf .
this curiosity also showed that whenever i was not in school , i went through the forests and collected samples and frogs and beetles and beetles and dough water , all brought them home and looked under the microscope .
in fact , i &apos;ve spent most of my career looking at terrible situations , and all of this just trying to study social resources that are engaging and interesting , and hopefully understanding in a way that makes them fun and accessible to the audience .
but there was only one company , an agency was willing to help us -- and even because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard kirshentree for years -- i realized that i had to do it myself , i had to bend the middle man and go right to the companies with my team .
another example : a few years ago , i got a 19-year-old man &apos;s call , who was born a boy , had a friend , had sex with his friend , lived as a man , and had just figured out he had ovaries and a uterus .
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a tune , which , as it &apos;s often difficult for inspiration , is agonizing for him , and he wants to have it . he &apos;s gorgeous . he &apos;s leans after that , but he can &apos;t believe it .
well , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite do i have on the toes of memories , but even if you make more of them , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight in the course of the weight that we give experiences ?
the next weeks i made a title , and i learned for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you can think of this cultural web as an ethnosphere , and ethnosphere can be defined as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths of ideas , inspiration and intuitions that have been defined by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
so where the founding fathers were extremely suspicious of finding out how individuals could be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we give them a concept , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
the main reason for this is that maybe we enjoy it , we enjoy these huge shelves of mayonaise , mustard , essig and martian , but we can &apos;t actually take the comparisons and drag the boundaries and then actually choose something out of the fantastic deal .
by playing music and talking about music , from this paranoid , confused man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a loving , educated , sketched , skilled musician in juilliard .
we talked about this issue . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the modern artist who was trying to master this uncontrollable creative impulse that lived inside him and deal with them .
i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i did with gur huberman , eden kamenica , wei jang , where we look at the decisions to save the retirement of almost a million americans from about 650 plans all over the united states .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting because it shows the ideality of bringing new elements into play -- like the testicles -- and also how the game requires trust and promotes -- while also having tremendous fun .
the reason for that is , if i were to draw it on a normal curve where , say , these are the years , so the timeline of a species , and this is any measure of the technology i wanted to represent with a graph , the graph will get silly .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i &apos;d ever had , and i think quite often about how often i think of other vacations .
and maybe also , a little bit of a glimpse of what might happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg &apos;s body to explore or do other things , in all sorts of post-humane futures that i can think of as a science fiction fan .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- to avoid things where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and they &apos;re going to welcome them , and they &apos;re actually going to turn them into something positive for themselves , and this is a sketchboard .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran , where a man who &apos;s sexually drawn to other men is punished by death , unless he &apos;s willing to sign himself a gender transformation in which case he &apos;s allowed to stay alive .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier through the use of the tricoder , and they &apos;re going to be more productive through the khan academy , and by doing so , they &apos;re going to be able to use 3d printers and infinite computing , and so much more productive than ever before .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t draw a line for us between male and female , or between male and intersexual and female and intersexual , and interactive , we are , in fact , that this line pretends to be natural .
so if you look at google glasses , for example , one concept that makes us recombine the virtual world with the real world is called our affinity to virtualization , which is to find virtual as something normal , natural , is appealed again .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect for some time , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in this , unless they look at it the way i do , &quot; a deception that becomes real if somebody believes hard enough of it . &quot;
we worked with roberto bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the √©tole at the metropolitan theater in new york and the scala in milan -- we took his movements in 3d to use them as a impulse to the flyfire .
there are some pilot projects that can do this on a 60 percent level -- 80 percent level , but getting it to 100 percent will be very difficult . and getting a deal to gain co2 is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the laureate timeline question .
so what you got was this : her name here , my tedtalk , which you have no idea what the topic is going to be , which could eventually fly you around your ears after content , especially if i let your company stand there for your participation .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to rediscover the possibility of being what we are : people with full consciousness who are aware of the importance of all the people and gardens being able to flourish a space . and there are great moments of optimism .
these older people are coming up to me now and saying , &quot; mr , stevenson , you talk , you tell people to stop telling us we have to do it for the first time in our nation &apos;s history : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
as a result , he &apos;s especially vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases now , which are sometimes so bad , and he disappears for days in the streets of skid row , always exposed to this horror and torture of his own mind .
the people in the back , or the people who see this later on , will say , &quot; well , this looks pretty impressive , but if it were real , he would -- look , here &apos;s a hole , and there , if it were really real , it would bleed . &quot;
so the tedtalk was a place in a very simple way that a charter city is a place whose early country is uninhabited , a founding contract that determines the laws that govern there , and people are able to decide either to live under these rules or not .
we followed geneaology eight generations , and we found two cases of natural death , and when we asked people about it a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the people had gotten so old that he died because of his age , and we still killed him with the spear .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple compared to ours , trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to one living cell .
if you allow me just one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is , halfway energy flow without co2 , i could take that wish .
it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for is somebody who &apos;s freaked up when he &apos;s in because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the branding when he &apos;s covered by a meter snow .
at that point , the patients come in . not only can they take control again , captain on their own ship , but can also help us with health care in the face of the challenges that are ahead of us , and the cost explosion of health , double-demand , and so on .
and then there &apos;s a memory of self , and the memory itself is the one that counts and receives the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor responds to by asking the question , &quot; how did you feel recently ? &quot;
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that have come to market recently , about how to best mandate choice , was something that david laibson did very much design with , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
about an hour after she arrived at home , after i sent her home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 , and the rescue assistants brought her back to the emergency station with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous shock state .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform off the malayan coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple to give me one of the men on the platform .
now , what this thing does is it captures the lovely values of sensors -- so for example , from pressure-sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate code that continues to happen while attacking , with false data .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species of adstranding plants find these two morphologically unrelated plants that , if they combine that way , create a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
and there was a time when there was only jeans in a way , and they bought them , and they missed them , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if they wore long enough , and they washed enough , they started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t notice that there are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way he processes information , it counts not one , two , three , but it sees it as a group .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story of what &apos;s going on at that time is that little oil droplet was flipping around , which had different kinds of chemicals in it .
and these sounds and rhythms have shown the geology , the topography of an area , and of course that has also enabled you to degrade these songs and put yourself in different ways and move left , right and also output .
how often did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we recline , and we expect that the government , reflects our values and fulfills our needs , and then not much has changed ?
now this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years before that , because this information had to be learned evolutionarily by the individuals who died because of this fruit , because these information processing structures weren &apos;t there .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people is being convicted in general , but the ethnocid , the destruction of people &apos;s lifestyle , is not only convicted , but in general and in many ways as part of a development strategy .
what if you could change the sperm and the eggs or the newly fertilized egg to give your children a better chance for a healthier life -- elimination of diabetes , remove the hemophilia , remove the risk of cancer ?
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , which are thermophil , and in doing so , survive the hot vapor , if fish were there , they would have the vacuum cooked fish , yet they &apos;ve managed to make it a habitable environment for themselves .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a communicator in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense but in the light of evolution . &quot;
and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve caused the living self to be worse off by a patient , and you &apos;ve caused the memory of the patient to be much better off from the patient a , because now you &apos;ve given patient a a a better story about your experience .
so not only is it a farm that not only feed its animals , not only is it a farm that measures its success in the health of its predators , but a farm that is literally a water treatment plant , not only for these fish , but for you and me .
that , as a translator , you have to understand not just the word &quot; text &quot; into a different language , but you have to understand the deeper sense of words and wortzus bias to make it a useful translation , anyone who has to do with foreign languages .
and when i step out again and look at everything , i can rearrange my trajectory maybe looking for my search past , and here , i &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic here for bing , or looking for live labs .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually expand the patient &apos;s reflection by just letting the tube in there without shaking too much on it .
you will do it for the task , for the will -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . you do it for the discovery of space , and because of the strange connection that comes from a small group of people forming a team .
i took them with sheep , and i gave them access to the world down there : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so they could look around , sample and test instruments , and so on .
you know , not only do you know that people have to eat dog food when they retire , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it also means making decisions so hard to miss big investment in their employers .
and throughout that entire time , they &apos;re culturally introduced to the values of their society . values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say that ecological -- maintain equilibrium .
there are , for example , the anecdote that the report of a captain who was watching great fish occurrences in this area cannot be used , or fisheries scientists don &apos;t usually get used because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
and wherever you look around the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not denied to the bottom . these are dynamic people whose existence is displaced by visible forces that go beyond their capacity of adaptation . whether it &apos;s in the process of immensely reforestation in the homeland of penan , a nomadity people from southeast south asia , a people who live in front of a generation in the forest now and now to kneumonia and prostitution on the u.s. river , where they can see that they can see , where the sea has been lowered , where the sea has been lowered , where the sea has been lowered .
the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content so it &apos;s realistic for you , and you actually live your life without oil . so , when you sign up to play , tell us where you live . and then you get news movies in real time that show you how much oil costs , what &apos;s not seen , how much food supplies , how transportation is being affected , whether there are schools closed , whether there are riots , and you have to figure out how you &apos;re designing your real life , if you were true . and we ask you to blog photos , or whether there &apos;s photos .
what ayahuasca makes so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of this prey , but the processing . it &apos;s really made from two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden liane , which has a series of bidder irins , harmin , harmolin , slightly hallucinating , this climber plant alone is like a blue smoke is put on its consciousness , but it &apos;s put on the side with the leaves of the coherent family called the coffee system .
just knowing that jaguar shamanas are still traveling beyond the milky way , or the meaning of the myths of the elders of the inuit still matter , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist still trace the breath of the dharma means calling the central revelation of anthropology into mind , which is the idea that the world in which we live , not only exists in an absolute sense , but as a model of reality , as a consequence of a certain set of possibilities that successfully chose our generations .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the penan in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo acolyths in haiti , or the warriors in the cairut-desert of northern kenya , the curoculum in the andean , or a caravan in the middle of the sahara . this is the collapse i happened to be traveling to the desert a month ago , or even a yak shepherd hanging on the qomolma desert , everest , the mother of the world .
how can i talk about the interconnectedness between women in 10 minutes , and how the amazing strength of this interconnectedness was manifest in the lives of a four-year-old girl in 10 minutes when she was more than 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and mother , for five days , and nights , sat in a small boat in the chinese sea . a interconnectedness that noted in the life of this little girl and never disappeared -- this little girl who now lives in san francisco and talks to you today ?
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visually impaired , knee joints from titan and artificial hip joints for aging , allowing people to really use all of their possibilities and go beyond the limits that their natural destiny has set them to develop , not to speak about social networking platforms , make people define their own identity in their own way , and define themselves in their own way , and guide themselves to groups around the world that are self-centering .
disabled , adjective : &quot; crawled , helpless , useless , destroyed , dead , mutilated , wounded , dedicated , lahm , separated perceived lost , balanced , impotent , bruised , paralyzed , handed , handicapt senil , age weak , drawn from traffic , restored , broken , broken , counted , searched , injured , useless and weak .
i &apos;m going to leave my closing words to an english scientist . humphrey davy , who , as i suspect , defended the useless experiments of his teaching , his apprentice was michael faraday , said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the development of the human mind as to assume that our scientific beliefs are valid , that there are no mysteries in nature that our triumphs are full , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
and we do a series of trips into the ethnosphere where we take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that you will find a way to be blinded by the blessed , and hopefully , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world has deserved to exist in various ways that we can find a way to live in a really multicultural pluralistic world where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our common well-being .
one of them is , by choosing a lot of different salatdressings , when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salatdressing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make another decision that would have been better . and what &apos;s happened is this image-making alternative leads you to regret the decision , and that regret works negatively on the happiness you made by your decision , even if it was good choice .
at the end of this amazing initiation , they &apos;re suddenly taken outside and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , you see a sunrise . and in this crystal moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to shine on the hangs of the amazing beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they learned in the abstract world will be revealed in astonishing glory . and the priest will come back and say , &quot; see ? it &apos;s really how i told you .
what was really extraordinary to me was that he was raising newspaper clips of my whole childhood , whether i &apos;d won them at a letter competition in second grade , whether i &apos;d been traveling to the pads at the parade to hallolance , whether i had my scholarship or one of my athletic victories , and he &apos;d been using these clips to teach his students , medical students from hahneman medical school and hey medical school .
and if you have people who are convinced that they have a soul , or you can say , who believe that they &apos;ve been brought to life by the soul , then they imagine that it &apos;s sort of like a spiritual framework that they have , not out of matter , themselves , but out of meat and blood , a little bit of stone , into the earth , sort of built , convenient , unimportant , dead , yes .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of way we interact with real objects -- with my professional adviser patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i began to wonder : what if we used computers that would be like a mouse tip that moves like a digital fingertip on a flat surface of the work -- what if we could intervene with both hands and intervene data physically and arrange it the way we want it ?
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the vocal age have come back to us so slightly in the machine age that , using what we call the cyber age , we can be activated , and that in this way , we can get back to our roots .
at this point , jafour said to octavio , &quot; what happens if we take an unsettled area of our country -- what if we just name it one message -- one part of the american embassy -- and then if people want to work under the canadian rules or the united states , they can work there , and they can do everything they usually have to go to canada or america on the surface of these messages ? &quot;
the young acolyths are separated from their families at age three and four , and in a shadow world of eclipse , in stone huts at the age of the glacier for 18 years , and two periods of each nine years are deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of pregnancy they spent in their light mother &apos;s lap , they now spend metamorphorphoric in the lap of the great mother .
i want to end with a poem written by a persian poet called hafiz in the 14th century , who told me about my friend jacques dembois , and the poem is , &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows god , not the god of the publishing , but the god who knows only four words and repeats them all the time , just says , &quot; come with me , dance with me . &quot;
if somebody has taken the trouble and labeled all these sacred people and told them who they are , my photograph of the notre dam cathedral suddenly becomes enriched with all this data , and i can use it as a starting point to dive into this space , into these metaverse , which takes photos of other people and make a kind of overcoming model of social experience with other providers .
a huge history of energy , but also there , of course , we have the problem of a growing company , and we have then two-thousandth , a small group of them decided that we start small again and go back and dedicate ourselves to the next topic of the future , and that , i think , is again crazy , which is starting again with people saying what the nonsense of the nonsense of doing , we don &apos;t talk about talking about talking .
there &apos;s not a lot of space in the malaria swamps of asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but they still , through time and ritual , shaped a mysterious nimbus of the earth that doesn &apos;t based on the idea of being aware of them , but on a much more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s breathed into the human mind .
so that the system develops to make backups , which make it easier to find mistakes that make people inevitable , and also allows lovely to create supportive spaces where anyone who sees the health care can actually address things that are potential errors and is even rewarded for it , and that especially for people like me to make mistakes and be rewarded for gratification of those .
in fact , i have discussed with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who discussed the psychedelic erea with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the &apos; 30s , and i argued that you couldn &apos;t put these tryptamins in as a hallucination , because the moment you feel the impact , you &apos;re no longer there to experience a hallucination .
many of you will know the story , because from steves &apos;s article on it later , a book that was filmed again , with robert downey junior when steve lopez and jamie foxx was a nathaniel anthony ayers , the contrabassistant who was studied at the juilliard conservatory , and whose promising career was tragically finished by his paranoid schizophrenia early on .
for example , women who pursued the election right , the concept of founding fathers , which says that anatomical similarity is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; we have a uterus and ovaries as a difference enough that we should not be right to vote , the right to own right to own , etc . &quot;
now we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors . but these services are especially common in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign providers like gmail because they know that they can trust them more than local providers and encrypted over ssl connections , so that the local government can &apos;t sniff around in their conversations .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who are involved in nasa and are struggling with nasa and are planning real space missions . they &apos;re going to go to russia , they &apos;re going through the mission of the biomedical protocol , all the way around , and off , fly to the international space station , and they &apos;re going to take our 3d camera system .
in my show , &quot; white coat , black artartwork , &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would be to say to everyone from the rescue assistant to the chief of the cardiologists , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , what about your ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show you the microphone to him .
when you come back to land and you say , &quot; we just didn &apos;t have to do it , the fiberglass , the shit , and the whole technology around it , and the difficulty , the human performance , if you work on sea , &quot; you just can &apos;t explain the other one . it &apos;s like police officers or soldiers who have done something together and you know they can never explain it to anybody .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who doesn &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing device , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you permission -- and maybe you can look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book , which is wrong , because nothing else will make sense of you in this talk .
a few years ago , the laser prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research , where he took a grown-up skin , a fibrobox , and by manipulating just four genes , the cell to bring it back to a pluripotent stem cell -- a cell potentially is able to become any cell in your body .
and to show you the dimension , i looked at all kinds of batteries that are made : the cars , computers , flashlights , for everything . and i compared that to the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , i found that all the batteries that we now produce could store less than 10 minutes of total energy .
now let &apos;s take a step back to the time of the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living things , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-cellular organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species , which , in the last 130,000 years , eventually , shape .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notre dame who ended up in the computer with images of flickr . just give notre dame in flickr , and you &apos;ll get images of men in t-shirts and in university centers and so on . each of these orange cone represents a picture that was detected as this model .
and yet , here in this country , in the ancient south states , we &apos;re targeting people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted to death , 11 times higher if the victim is white than when the black is black . 22 times higher when the folded black is and the victim knows -- in the same state in which the body is borrowed .
i once went to lhasa with a young colleague &apos;s 6,000 miles from chengdu in west china , through southeast tibet , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear . 6,000 holy monuments that were transformed into rubble and ashes . 1.2 million people killed during the cultural revolution by the kagers .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems to invest in something you just have later -- and this is not so clear to invest . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world who are looking at ipcc and saying , okay , this is not a big drama .
we cleaned the chromosome from a microphone species . roughly speaking , these two are as far apart as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to choose this chromosome . we deconstructed it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell -- and they &apos;ll estimate our very mature graphs here .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died , that it &apos;s her greatest fear that as we move towards a thread , discretionary , generic view , we would see not only the entire range of human imagination reduced in a measured way of thinking , but that one day we wake up from a dream and forgot that there were ever other possibilities .
i &apos;d like to just point out one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on first in the summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , photosynths technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect in some studies , the placebo effect , because the person thinks what &apos;s happening to them is that it &apos;s a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in pain management , for example , if the patient believes solid enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
when a no said it was the vetoprinzip , which has completely crashed you . i &apos;ve been hard for 10 years to tell you whether i was doing my great engineering study , maybe really , really , to a dazzling thing , because all my father &apos;s colleagues were always talking to him , you &apos;ve taken out the money to the window in your child .
i had such an encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who is now over 90 , but who was more poet all of her life , and she told me that when she was growing up in southern virginia outside in the fields , she said she could feel and hear how a poem came to her landscape .
it means that a young child will grow up in the andean who &apos;s in the belief that the mountain is an apu spirit , who is his or her destiny , will become a very different person , and have a different relationship with this resource or this place than a little kid in montana , who grows up in thinking that a mountain is a bunch of stones that can be carried away .
and that would be your answer to the bjurn lomborg argument that if you use all that time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other targets that suffer poverty reduction , malaria reduction and so on , that there &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money while there are better things we can do .
these people have come online to wealth , but they have acquired it illegal using , say , trojans to claim money from our bank accounts while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or keyloggers , who have collected our credit card details in the back of the keyboard while we &apos;re buying about an infected computer online .
my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that happened will be . and i thought , since i &apos;m among friends , i would tell you what i really think . and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s really happening here with these incredible leaps forward , which are so fast that we can barely keep up with .
the woman parks kept coming back to montgomery , where she had two of her oldest friends , these older women , johnnie carr , who had organized the montgomery bus boycott -- an incredible african-american woman -- and virginia durr , a white one whose husband , cliffdurr , dr. king .
and they ran into two builders and said , &quot; o.k , we &apos;re doing this easier and cheaper , and then we &apos;re getting out of open source , so free hardware , electronics , this device assembled , and now they &apos;re even brought it to the market , and now the cheapest vendor in the world is .
that made me another person than my friends under the kwakiutl , who believe that these forests were the place of hukuk and the commandments of heaven snival and the cannibalic spirits that live on the northerners of the world , spirits that they would participate in their hamatsa initiation .
a week ago , at the national academy of engineering , gave the draper prize for francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists who developed independently the natural process of evolution to work faster and lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- what frances called &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
and right now , also , in biology , and that &apos;s where i want this metaphor that &apos;s coming from synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because the d.n.a code is an abstract code , which is yes , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s more dynamic matter , so it &apos;s real matter , and it &apos;s not just cyber .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at brighton university , has gone so far as to say that this mass media , he says the book and the picture , not television , the internet and so on , and what we call a mass media today , have fossilized this mass media of our memories and enabled our ability to virtualize .
really , some happy people and companies , for-profit and non-profit , got the unprecedented opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let that go -- buy the name rights on the talk that you just see at that point that didn &apos;t have a lot of titles or a lot of content and didn &apos;t have a lot of clues about what the subject would actually be .
this is a set of skills that are happening by the idea that success or happiness depends on embracing a challenge without being coined by the connected experience , as if my life had gone so successful because i could outweigh the possible traces of a life with a prosthetic , or whatever people perceive me with my disability .
and when these people came and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world , this was not a mit professor , nor a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who worked as a business assistant in a rehab clinic at night , who was the best protein anchor in the world .
this was , of course , just a simple trick by dr. p. so that i could do the exercises that i didn &apos;t want to make , with the insight that richest five year-old girls in the hospital in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily practice horror with new eyes , so it became a new and promising experience .
while i was looking for models last year to do this , i was also looking for the past , and i was trying to find other societies to see if they might have better or more sensible ideas about it than we could to help to take on the emotional risks associated with creativity .
so we have a situation like this where , as our science continues , we have to admit around us so much that these categories that we had thought of as stable anatomical categories that made very simple assignments to create permanent identity scores are much smarter than we did .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about this is that a uranium molecule has a million times the amount of energy it has on its land and say , a coal molecule , and so if you can deal with the problems , and these are the main radiation , the footprint and the cost , is the potential , so the effects on the land and other things , almost in your own league .
so i went home , and i ate with my wife , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , we should find a way to control a laser so that he can do graffiti again , that would be great . &quot;
in the early &apos; 80s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and infiltrating the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of duvalier and tonton macoutes and the poison that was used to make sure of zombies .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people kept asking me to tell me how to deal with odds , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this phrase never fed for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with answering the questions of people , and i think , gradually , i understand why .
and if i transmit this now , for example , by jumping on this as a supervision , by selecting , by informing in the trap , it &apos;s big at me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , i can transcend it somewhere in the throat or sending or sending and so on .
i recommend all of you to read steves book or to watch the film so that not only did you understand the wonderful connection that was born between these two men , but also how music helped to connect that , and how it eventually was the instrument when that word game was allowed to get mithalf , nathaniel away from the street .
down here in the picture , you see the lab , in leadership strikes , so there &apos;s a garage like this with all kinds of lab rubber that college has equipped out , a group in paris that &apos;s kind of focused on what &apos;s up there , and it &apos;s also doing some pretty interesting things , and i want to cut a project for a second .
no biologist , for example , would argue that 50 percent or more of all species are just about to die out , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the most apocalyptic scenarium in the field of biodiversity -- is barely what we know to be the most optimistic scenarium in the field of cultural diversity .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves on a place , and there are a lot of interesting openness rules for everything called the nuclear . there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china , and i &apos;ve met the energy eminent , and i &apos;ve talked about how this fits to the energy agenda .
the computer vision-algorithms have held these pictures together so that they can hold up to the real room , where these images , which were all taken near the grassi lakes in the canadian rockies , which you see here are elements of stabilized slides or panoramic imaging , and these things were all spatially related to each other .
and if you look at the software we just saw , partly , you &apos;ll understand why ninety-nine percent of our software today is less intuitive or not based on anxious , including the i-pad in many areas or i-phone , although it &apos;s already much more intuitive than classic software .
the result is -- we call it patient autonomy . it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift in responsibility for making decisions from somebody who knows something -- namely , the doctor -- to someone who knows nothing and is highly ill , and therefore not to make a decision -- namely , the patient .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing of class eat , pray , love , and i fell into one of those pelvis of doubt that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking it &apos;s going to be a disaster . this is the worst book ever written .
we also have one of the same size aggregate that it sits there , put it into the hall to actually simulate the entire dynamic behavior of this web , so in the halle it looks like this , there &apos;s the big battery in the back here , there &apos;s all the judge that we simulate the web .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical creature that was believed to be living literally in the walls of an artist &apos;s walls -- like dobby , the house 11 -- that came out and to the artist at work , in a certain way , make the result of the work .
if i want to close to you today , it &apos;s that the sum of the data that we consume is greater than the sum of its parts , and rather than thinking about information overload , i want you to think about how we can use information to make patterns emerge , and we &apos;re seeing trends that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been seen .
so in a study i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro artictero , we did a study with the people at ing -- employees who worked for ing -- and these people were all in a gathering where they signed up their participation for their retirement plan .
interesting historical footnote : when the moses conquered southern spain , they brought this practice , and the pronounces changed over the centuries of pass allah , allah , allah , to express ol√© , which you still hear in stiff and flamenco dances .
now today , you need , if you want to win a race , actually , something like this -- something that has the car in real time , some thousand sensors that pass that information on from the car , and then process that information , and then use it to send that car back and change things in real time , while information is collected .
i was afraid , not opinion , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship with the violin when i started talking about pitches and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic gardening .
so , the fact is that in the 20th century , in 300 years , you will remember not for your wars or technological innovation , but rather than an era in which we were against and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth either actively accepted or passively accepted . so the problem is not the change .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which was to push the knife of things that were visual effects and computer generators throughout new heights with realistic human , expressive characters made using cg , and the main characters should be all cg . and the world should be cg .
i &apos;m probably hearing , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that &apos;s been sent to this bad oko image , because i &apos;ve already started studying machine construction in cardboard rough , technical college , i think , today , she says , kit .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures , who had a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he heard a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music , and at the very end of the recording there was a terrible circulating sound .
you know ? i think allowing a mere person to think that he &apos;s thinking , or she &apos;s like the vessel , like the basin and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , infinite mysteries is a little too much responsibility to burst you from a fragile human psyche .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time you can eliminate the co2 , the skeptics also say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it emitting co2 , i wish it was almost that it was done , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who had , say , two gut reflections in two different surgeons and decides which one to vote , then the one who chooses the memory is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s going to be selected .
you all know the healthy shame , when you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s prize , even though it swells you on vulnerability and then you get the best friend confronted you with it and my terrible discussion , but when you end up leading you the bad conscience , and you sweat that you never make that mistake again .
you know , one of the great nographs in traveling , and one of the joys in ethnography is to live with the people who can remember the old days , and the ones who still feel their past in the wind , touch them on the rain , taste them in the bitter leaves of the plants .
if you ever have a chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , they all do -- you &apos;ll see that the people who call the government for many different problems , including that there &apos;s a marsupial in your house .
the thing that &apos;s really nice about this is , if you do this , you know , agriculture , you produce biogas , you know , on a hectare of five thousand dollars in favelas , so a farmer can produce about a thousand dollars , and have the facility with it , chickens and pigs and vegetables and fish .
so by comparing color , contrast and brightness to the edges of the individual images , photographic deprivation , like field depth , escaped colors and disorders , we wipe the boundaries between the different images and make them look like a single photo , even though a picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
if i were to go into a room full of colleagues and ask them their immediate support , and tell them what i just told you , i probably wouldn &apos;t reach the end of the second story before they got really uncomfortable , anybody would take a joke , they would change the topic and forget the rest .
we &apos;re astounding , amazing events in many areas . and yet i really think that we have to go back hundreds and 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time when we fought progress , where we &apos;ve driven over these things to be more front-sized than we are now .
